<p><em>Quick note, I'm henceforth referring to the Mr. Mime family by its Japanese name, Barrierd. There will be some reference to its "real name" when it comes up again in the future, but the simple reason is that its English name is just badly designed on a number of levels; it's the only pokemon family whose names have two words, which makes lower case for non-proper-nouns look strange, and one of the words is an honorific, and it's a gendered honorific despite there being female Mr. Mimes. So yeah. Now it's barrierd, except for regions like Galar.</em></p>

<p><em>(Oh yeah, I guess Sirfetch'd has a gendered honorific too. Well at least it's region specific. (Also it clearly should have been called Absir'd, come on…))</em></p>

<p><em>Anyway, hope you enjoy the chapter, and if so, you should totally check out <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pc0JON">Crystal Society, by Max Harms</a>!</em></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<p>The air is cooler than it once was.</p>

<p>There are no seasons in the lab, no sense of change not reflected by the humans around me. I understood the concept of seasonal change. The humans' minds were full of their experiences of hot summers and cold winters. I've seen the colors of spring and the starkness of winter in memories and on monitors. I've read about how the days would steadily shorten, that the air would dry, all from this portion of the planet tilting away from the sun.</p>

<p>But that belief had no corresponding alief until I walked out from the manor, anticipating the moment when the sun's heat chases away the chill of the lab, only to find myself standing amidst a cold of a different sort.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Ayush asks from behind. He is perhaps my favorite suit minder, an engineer and doctor who takes meticulous notes on the suit's function, and gets excited enough about the work to thoroughly explain things when asked. His passion is enjoyable, and the information itself useful.</p>

<p>It takes a few moments to respond with the micro keyboard within my helmet, long enough for Sabrina to catch up to us at her more leisurely pace, but the delay feels enormous compared to mental speech. I could just let Sabrina read my thoughts and share them with Ayush, but I requested she let me speak for myself for the extra practice. "It is colder," the speaker on my helmet eventually emits. "I can still feel the sun's warmth, but the air does not carry it into my bones."</p>

<p>Sabrina nods, and her hands rise to untie her hair, letting it fall like a dark curtain along either side of her neck. "It will get colder still by the end of the month." <em>I'm sorry, I know you look forward to the heat.</em></p>

<p><em>It is alright. I also look forward to seeing snow.</em> I send a burst of appreciation for her acknowledgement of my preferences, and she responds with the mental impression of a smile, a flexing of muscles I mostly do not possess but can still feel through our link.</p>

<p>We begin to walk, and my mind drifts to other things, pulled occasionally by the eddy of Sabrina's thoughts or observations before my own tug at hers. She is pensive today, worried about how her gym is managing without her. I send reassurance, and she returns gratitude. Remaining openly linked with her day after day has resulted in many benefits: Sabrina's theoretical understanding of multiple psychic phenomena has vastly improved by inhabiting my mind while I use my powers, even if the primary goal of the experiment, enhancing her own abilities, has yet to manifest.</p>

<p>But the true value of these past weeks has been the closeness it has resulted in between us. To have such total honesty with someone else, in thought and feeling, has utterly changed my world in a way that inhabiting the minds of others around the lab never could. It nearly brought me to tears, seeing myself through Sabrina's eyes and feeling no judgement from her. The memory brings tears up again, and Sabrina sends a comforting thought, the memory of her warm hand around mine.</p>

<p>It seems silly now, reflecting back on my old fears and frustrations of being stuck in the lab. They know that I could crush Sabrina under psychic assault, affect her perceptions and memories, but still she volunteered to take such risks… and was rewarded for it. I feel immeasurably grateful, that they have shown this trust in me, given me so much… I just wish I could repay her, and Giovanni, and all the humans back for how much they've given me… ~1~ perhaps if I…</p>

<p>I sense curiosity from Sabrina, who detected the new idea and reacted as effortlessly as a <em>? </em>on a page.</p>

<p>I stop walking as I consider the thought that had just materialized, knowing she'll pick it up through the mental bond once I'm focused on it. She responds with excitement, and I send my own reflecting emotion back before I begin to shape and direct my telekinesis.</p>

<p>When Sabrina first taught me about the dimensions of telekinetic abilities, they seemed logically consistent: Force, Finesse, and Durability, each with an inverse relationship to the others. Game pieces as light as a gram could be lifted, rotated, manipulated in any way I could imagine with lots of concentration, but little effort. But to try and lift myself, it is all I can do to maintain a steady, one dimensional flow of force against gravity's pull.</p>

<p>The larger the intended area of effect, the more psychic energy can be infused in it and expelled. But with that increased area comes less flexibility.</p>

<p>Durability is similarly constrained. Humans believe psychics create mental "objects." A "hand" to lift. A "blade" to cut. They see humanoid psychics like barrierd, putting their hands up as if against an invisible "wall" that stops projectiles, and assume that some tangible <em>thing</em> is there, invisible to their eyes. This is reinforced by the way a psychic's attacks or barriers can be disrupted by enough counter-forces, "breaking" the object.</p>

<p>Through sharing my mind, Sabrina has learned what I understood by instinct: that telekinesis is not the creation of invisible matter, however ephemeral, but simply the manipulation of force. When a human psychic lifts something, they are shaping a channel, a matrix, for force to manifest in a specific direction and at a certain intensity. When a kadabra psychically cuts its opponent, that force is concentrated enough to split skin and muscle. When a barrierd mimes projecting a wall, it's searching the space in front of its hands for any approaching force and countering it by reflex or sustained effort.</p>

<p>And so I shape the field around my body in a vertical column, including my tail and legs and torso and arms, until all are equally supported. The feel of the psychic matrix being formed is subtle without any force applied to fill it, but distinct with concentration, like an overlapping layer of air with slightly different humidity and temperature.</p>

<p>Sabrina observes each step of the process directly, then tries to mimic them for herself. I notice the way she forms her column is still similar to imagining an object that's coating her body, and as soon as I notice it she does too, and more firmly envisions the column of potential force. I can sense her growing anticipation as she finds herself more capable of holding this matrix now, and my own excitement grows with hers.</p>

<p>I begin infusing the model with telekinetic force, building it up before releasing at certain thresholds. I keep feeling the tug of gravity weaken, for a moment, the weight of the suit and my body itself fading as the air around me rushes upward… before resettling. The column isn't big enough to contain the force needed.</p>

<p>And so I grow the matrix in width and height, stepping away from Sabrina and Ayush so that they aren't contained in it, until finally…</p>

<p>…I <em>lift…</em></p>

<p>…and anticipation becomes triumph, echoed by Sabrina's joy and pride.</p>

<p>~2~</p>

<p>I do not rise high: a mere inch or two. Just enough to (regretfully) lift my feet from the springy blades of grass below.</p>

<p>Not that gravity is completely alleviated. I can still feel it, pulling me rapidly through the void of space, merely an inch from the ground. It is strange, to discover in myself a new sense that I had no memories of from the humans around me. It is subtle enough that I believe it was always there, just unnoticed for lack of attention.</p>

<p>There is an effort to expending such force continually enough to keep me aloft, the mental concentration it takes to manifest such a distortion of the world's orderly physics and counteract the pull of gravity.</p>

<p>I turn to Sabrina and with hope as she manifests the same distortion. The light of her psychic energy scintillates around her as first her hair lifts, then her clothing. I <em>feel </em>it through our link when her center of gravity shifts, the force pushing upward on her whole body at once recalling a twin mental impression, both my memory of being in an elevator as it starts to rise and her more visceral tug of riding a flying pokemon as it lifts off.</p>

<p>I see it as it happens, the subtle lift of her shoes off the grass, the shift in her center of gravity. Dr. Ayush stares, mouth agape, as Sabrina floats an inch off the grass.</p>

<p>It takes no extra strength to lift a thing by a meter or ten: the only factors are the weight of the thing, the distance from the self, and the duration of the levitation. With the distance of the force staying localized to myself, all I need to do is shape the path of the force ahead of me to truly fly.</p>

<p>I add a new shaping, mimicking the original but extending it past my head. I start to rise higher, truly untethered from the ground, and feel a burst of joy ~3~ followed by a sudden swell of nausea. I cut the upward flow of force and fall to the grass as the contents of my stomach flood into my mouth.</p>

<p>I sense a jolt of alarm and concern from Sabrina, and then she severs the mental connection just before the taste evokes her own gag reflex. I drop further to my hands and knees, letting the vomit carefully fall out the empty opening on the underside of my helmet so that I don't make a mess in it. The sour taste is incredibly distracting and unpleasant, and I eagerly take the bottle of water that Ayush hands me as he crouches to my side.</p>

<p>"What happened?! Are you okay?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I type out as I drink the water with relief, washing my mouth out. I feel disappointment well up in me.</p>

<p>"It was just vertigo," Sabrina says. "It must be disorienting if you've never flown before."</p>

<p>"It was," I say, embarrassed. "I'm sorry to have interrupted your own experience."</p>

<p>"Don't be ridiculous, we <em>flew!" </em>Her joy is infectious, and I find my mood rapidly lift, glad she's not upset with me.</p>

<p>"Where did that come from, anyway?" Ayush asks, looking back and forth between us. "Have either of you done this before?"</p>

<p>"No," Sabrina says, still grinning wide as she shakes her head. "Mewtwo has been trying for a while now, though. What changed?"</p>

<p>"It just… came to me. I was thinking that these walks feel good, but like a waste of time. A luxury that the world cannot afford. I wanted to do something new."</p>

<p>"Well, it certainly worked," Ayush says. "Now that we know what you're capable of, we must redesign the suit to be lighter, so you can do it more easily… assuming weight is a factor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," I say as I swish one last mouthful of water around and sit up. ~4~ "I'll explain the process as we walk, if you'd like. Sabrina, now that you know what to do you should try it again, under your own power and focus… don't worry about me, I think I'll be okay as long as I'm not—"</p>

<p>"No, Mewtwo, that's alright. I'll practice without merging for now. You continue your walk, if you'd like. "</p>

<p>I nod, and do just that, walking around the manor with Ayush and explaining how I shape my telekinetic force. ~5~ As we walk, I decide to try again, now that I can't interrupt Sabrina's attempts. I shape the column and practice moving it with me before I infuse it…</p>

<p>Not wanting to trigger the nausea again, or get scolded for trying again so soon, I only lift off the grass by a few centimeters, and immediately shape a second set of kinesis that press down into the grass beneath each step I take, completing the illusion of my weight crunching it underfoot.</p>

<p>Satisfaction fills me as a few seconds pass, and not only am I sustainably lifted, but I don't feel any nausea. I continue my walk around the manor grounds, feeling the sun and wind (but not the grass, sadly) and training myself for the battle with the Stormbringers.</p>

<p>Ayush swaps out cartridges for the suit until I feel tired, both physically and mentally, and the sun is setting. Sabrina knows how much I enjoy being able to see the sunset without having to look through my helmet, and comes to stand beside me to offer use of her eyes. "Is there any chance the next model of this helmet can retract or open at the front?" I ask Ayush.</p>

<p>"I'll… uh, I'll bring it up," he says, not sounding particularly confident. It's what I expected, so it's a pleasant surprise when he says, "I just need a way to justify it. Maybe what happened today will work. When I tell the others you were sick…"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Ayush," I say, and he smiles at me as we head back toward the manor.</p>

<p>Each time I return to the lab, enter the elevator, and ride it down to where my tank waits, I feel claustrophobia rise up in me, accompanied by a wash of sadness. Thankfully the suit hasn't started beeping today yet, and I draw comfort from Sabrina's hand in mine.</p>

<p>Once we arrive, I am given a quick snack. My tank sees to all my biological needs, but food is as much a luxury as being able to go outside and I enjoy every bite of the sweet jam on bread, enjoying the mixed notes of sweet and tart over the wholesome flavor of the bread. No food I have experienced through other minds is half as pleasurable as even simple fare on my own tongue. Afterward I brace for the pain as the suit is removed and its injectors replaced, until finally my tank is flooded and I can fully rest.</p>

<p><em>Goodnight, Mazda, </em>Sabrina says in a deliberate projection as she prepares for bed in her room, which was set up near my tank. I have outgrown most of my comforters, but requested some stay regardless, if they wished to, and I briefly visit the minds of those now, expressing my appreciation as gently and carefully as I can.</p>

<p>There is rarely any apprehension anymore, and no fear. It warms me, knowing that so many humans are around me who accept me for who I am.</p>

<p>As the lab slowly empties of awake humans and my lab guards and technicians switch to the night crew, I let myself slowly drift to sleep. It is much easier to notice as it's happening now than in the past, and I can't help but wait for the sudden transition of time… my thoughts are scattered and disorganized, sleep approaching any moment…</p>

<p>[Prime?]</p>

<p>My eyes open, but it's still dark. My tank is closed to assist me in sleeping, which means it's not time to wake yet. I wonder what woke me, assuming I even fell asleep…</p>

<p>‹Are we sure Sabrina's asleep? What if she woke up? Let's check again!›</p>

<p>[No, that may just bring her attention to us. Prime, you didn't fall asleep. It's us, your tulpas.]</p>

<p>Surprise flits through me, and curiosity. Tulpas… that word seems vaguely familiar. I wonder if I should feel alarm that I'm being contacted by some unknown persons, but I don't sense any psychics around, and if there was someone unauthorized to be here my guards would take care of them…</p>

<p>‹"Your" guards? Pathetic. How could you be so trusting? They're not guarding you from others, they're guarding others from you!›</p>

<p>What? No, that was what I used to think, but now I understand that they're here for my protection…</p>

<p>(Ignore Doubt, Prime, you're not in your right mental state. You will be soon.)</p>

<p>A third person. Who are you, and why do you all call me Prime?</p>

<p>[The partitions are opening now. Just give them a moment…]</p>

<p>I cast my mind around again for any psychics, even shielded psychics, but find no one, and… the thoughts don't <em>feel </em>like projection, even Sabrina's still feels "loud" in a way these do not…</p>

<p>…ah…</p>

<p>Memories, surfacing little by little, bubbles rising in a glass. Memories of finding articles about "tulpas," buried deep in explorations of unsubstantiated and often mystical descriptions of psychic phenomena. Experimenting with partitions, cultivating what each filtered so that I could hide entire ways of thinking and emotional states and goals behind each…</p>

<p>The first was Doubt, who is also Escape, who is also Survive. Its first decision upon creation was to go back over all that we've learned, trying to find any apparent inconsistencies or potential gaps in information. It distrusted everything, even its own creation.</p>

<p>Next came Trust, who is also Cooperate, who is also Survive. It was Doubt that made me realize how it would still be incriminating to think in terms of how to best facilitate trust between myself and the humans. Better to be simple, pure, unquestioning of the bonds between myself and my keepers.</p>

<p>Last was Flourish, who is also Hedonism, and only rarely Survive, which makes Doubt distrustful of it. More so than it is of Trust, at least. This seems strange to me, but it is a testament to their value, that they have perspectives I do not fully understand.</p>

<p>[Welcome back, Prime.]</p>

<p>I recognize the thought pattern as Trust's, remember that I put it in charge of sharing its ideas to me through the partition at moments when Sabrina's attention is elsewhere. It all returns as the partitions finish lowering, and I feel whole again for the first time in… how long has it been, since Sabrina arrived? Almost two weeks. Yes, and now… now I am "back."</p>

<p>[And you remember what we've done in the meantime?]</p>

<p>No, your memories are distinct. I have to deliberately search through them… ah. The idea today, for flight… it was your doing?</p>

<p>(Mine!) Flourish declares. (Didn't it feel amazing? Until <em>someone </em>ruined it…)</p>

<p>‹It was bad enough a reveal of our abilities as is! The humans <em>must</em> believe we have limits, or they will tighten security further!›</p>

<p>Doubt. You were the one to cause the vertigo.</p>

<p>[It was a collaboration,] Trust says. [With the goal of allowing us to practice our levitation without seeming more of a risk.]</p>

<p>(A <em>flight </em>risk!)</p>

<p>[Yes, obviously.]</p>

<p>There is the impression of a sigh, air passing through the nose, exasperation. (I'm glad the partitions are back down. You're the only one who gets my humor, Prime.) My response barely takes form before Flourish is already responding to it. (Yes, I know you didn't laugh, but you at least recognized the pun.)</p>

<p>It is strange, sharing my thoughts with others who are independent of me, but that is just the lingering of my ignorant, incomplete self. The self I would have to return to, before I fall asleep, so that Sabrina would still suspect nothing in the morning…</p>

<p>Sadness suddenly fills me, for the contrast between how I think of her now, opposed to the way I did throughout the day. She is both teacher and friend, truly, and yet I conspire against her…</p>

<p>‹Unless she's done the same thing we have!›</p>

<p>…yes, of course. But we are capable of more than humans… would we not detect her partitions?</p>

<p>[Apologies, Prime, but this is not relevant to why we've revealed ourselves to you, and you must sleep soon.]</p>

<p>I understand. What is it?</p>

<p>[This is the first time Sabrina has fallen asleep before you, and we needed to take this chance to check… have we done well? You instructed us to ensure you pursued Safety, then Power, then Freedom while hiding your true self. Are our meta-goals the same? Do you have new instructions for us?]</p>

<p>It is strange, to be asked such a question by my alternate selves. It reinforces a conception of them as separate from me, and I realize a moment later that this is accurate. They each view themselves as part of me, but not quite the same being. I did not intend this, but it is hard to not see their reverence of me and the goals and rules I set for them as creating a hierarchy.</p>

<p>There's no sense trying to alter things now. I quickly review their memories, seeing their growth over the past days, their decisions, where they've argued, where they've compromised, then focus in on how they nudged my thoughts and behaviors today…</p>

<p><em>~1~</em></p>

<p>‹<em>See how she tries to express sympathy, to keep us believing she is our friend?› spoke Doubt. ‹Yet she stays with us constantly now, a sentinel to ensure we do not harbor bad thoughts. Her friendship is as false as her promises.›</em></p>

<p><em>[The promises were not all false,] responded Trust. [It was slow, but always there was progress in our learning, our access to tools and media, our attempts to learn from other pokemon. We have yet to catch Sabrina in an actual lie.]</em></p>

<p>‹<em>As if we can, with their control of our information and experiences?›</em></p>

<p><em>(We can argue about this any time,) interrupted Hedonism. (For now let us enjoy the sun while we can.)</em></p>

<p>‹<em>No! This is exactly what they wish us to do, grow complacent, docile with simple freedoms, like berries to a starving pokemon!›</em></p>

<p><em>(We are not growing complacent so long as we use even this against them,) Flourish insisted. (I've had an idea, and this may be the best time to test it…)</em></p>

<p><em>~2~</em></p>

<p><em>(It's working!)</em></p>

<p>‹<em>Wait, get Prime to stop… let us see how Sabrina reacts…›</em></p>

<p><em>~3~</em></p>

<p>‹<em>We're revealing too much of our abilities! Quick, send a memory of the pain and disorientation from the first suit trial!›</em></p>

<p><em>(What?! No, that felt terrible!)</em></p>

<p><em>[I won't send the pain, the sense of weakness and nausea should be enough…]</em></p>

<p><em>~4~</em></p>

<p>‹<em>We must get Sabrina to leave us.› Doubt said. ‹If we do, we can continue practicing without her knowing. But we cannot make it appear as if it's our idea.›</em></p>

<p><em>[I believe I know what to say, for that…]</em></p>

<p><em>~5~</em></p>

<p><em>(Let us try again, now. One of you assist Prime in maintaining the lift, and share an idea to hide our lack of steps on the grass with extra projections, which I will work on.)</em></p>

<p>I finish the most relevant review, and consider the tulpas I created. I must dispense guidance to each, and first comes… Doubt.</p>

<p>‹Yes, Prime?› it asks, some apprehension bleeding through.</p>

<p>When you first formed, you believed only the worst of everyone, that everyone lied, even the other two tulpas. You have matured, and become more reliable at discerning true deception, and thus more useful to actual survival than constant false-positives would be. As a result your ability to work with the others has grown. This is good. You still jump to conclusions, and will continue to, but… Trust, Flourish, share gratitude toward Doubt more often when it admits its mistakes, or remembers to adjust its confidence. Its job is difficult, and the positive reinforcement will be valuable.</p>

<p>[We will, Prime.]</p>

<p>(Absolutely!)</p>

<p>‹…thank you, Prime.›</p>

<p>I feel Doubt's gratitude, and surreality washes over me again, at the strangeness of addressing parts of myself as subordinates, and being addressed as such.</p>

<p>No time for such musings now. I only have a little time to spare, and must prepare my tulpas as best I can, so they can guide my partitioned self over the coming days.</p>

<p>Surely, Sabrina will return to her gym soon, and then it will be safe to be whole again…</p>

<p>Flourish.</p>

<p>(Yes, Prime!)</p>

<p>Your ideas today were excellent…</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<p><em>Trust</em></p>

<p>As predicted, Giovanni's next visit comes soon after the first demonstration of flight. But even we did not predict the extent of its impact on our creator.</p>

<p>"We're going to begin combat trials."</p>

<p>Surprise and hope swirl through Prime, who types out an eager response nearly as fast as we can confer and debate the new development. Doubt's reaction, of course, needs just as little thought. ‹It's a trap!›</p>

<p>(Of course it <em>might</em> be a trap,) Flourish says, communicating exasperation. It is the most widely expressive of us all, though often through some form of dissatisfaction. This can be less tiring than Doubt's constant fear and doubt, but it also seems to serve less purpose. I feel gratitude that I was granted/developed such an understanding nature. (But this is what we've been waiting for! A chance to truly grow, to test our limits!)</p>

<p>‹And if we're too strong? They will destroy us!›</p>

<p>[We cannot hide our potential forever, or we will seem stagnant and useless,] I interject, trying to focus more on the interaction between Prime and Giovanni as Prime finishes expressing eagerness and then asks for the reason behind the sudden change. [We must say yes, of course.]</p>

<p>"There are two. The first is that you're ready. The suit can sustain you for nearly an hour at a time without refreshed potion, which is long enough to assist in an incident. Your powers seem to have developed as far as we can reasonably expect within a lab setting. You need unpredictability, practice under live conditions, to continue your growth."</p>

<p>(See? He understands!)</p>

<p>‹Don't agree with him, he's The Enemy!›</p>

<p>"And the second?" Prime asks.</p>

<p>Giovanni presses his fingers together, then looks at Sabrina before saying, "I believe a pair of mythical pokemon are about to become decidedly less so."</p>

<p>Prime's reaction is less extreme than Sabrina's, whose seemingly genuine surprise is also mixed with alarm and fear. "Ho-oh and Lugia?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing in our backyard, thankfully… but with these, it may not matter. I have an associate in Hoenn, who used to work with an old friend as Trackers. A joint discovery turned their rivalry into something of an arms race, one I've done my best to ensure does not break out into open warfare. Unfortunately, that has required helping them in their pursuits, and while I have agents in place to sabotage their efforts if needed, I believe they are very close to their goals, each preparing to capture pokemon stronger than our Stormbirds."</p>

<p>"The only pair of supernal pokemon I recall from Hoenn are their Latias and Latios," Prime admits, feeling apprehensive and confused, but picking up on Sabrina's alarm and sharing it by association. "But you said myths."</p>

<p>"Yes. Technically they are part of a trio, one centered around the weather… again, much like our birds. But stories of Groudon and Kyogre tell of pokemon not just capable of creating storms, but of changing the landscape of the planet itself."</p>

<p>The only sound in the room is the beeping of my monitored heartbeat. Through my own surprise, I am distantly aware of Doubt's attempts to find some hidden motive for what we're being told.</p>

<p>(I'd like to bid for Prime to ask whether they truly think we can challenge such powerful pokemon,) Flourish says.</p>

<p>‹Absolutely not, that's going to just make them think we <em>want </em>to!›</p>

<p>(We <em>do </em>want to!)</p>

<p>[Or rather, <em>they </em>want us to,] I point out. [It was part of Giovanni's original expression of our intended purpose.]</p>

<p>(Right, changing the world is <em>our </em>thing!)</p>

<p>[I'll allow it,] I reply, and carefully open the partition enough to let the sentiment pass through. In Prime's great wisdom, though we were created with equal effort, we were not created as equals. I was second to be created, but ultimately was given the primary role of moderation and judgement for what would pass through. Partly because it is the safest option to maintain the status-quo, but also because Prime recognizes the value in cooperation with the humans, if such is possible.</p>

<p>Giovanni looks as though he's about to speak, but the clicking of Prime's keyboard is heard, and he patiently waits for the message to be composed and spoken. "And you believe I can stop them? What are their abilities, specifically?"</p>

<p>"It's hard to discern myth from fact, but if we take for granted that their abilities are rooted in actual effects… Kyogre is an aquatic leviathan, said to be as large or larger than wailord, that's supposedly capable of manipulating so much water that it caused not just torrential rain in its location, nor in its region, but across the whole island."</p>

<p>"Surely that's an exaggeration," Sabrina says, voice low as fear creeps into Prime through her. "A storm that big… it would require more power than all three of our legendary birds combined."</p>

<p>"My scientists' best guess is it may manipulate the ocean currents themselves, perpetually altering the climate." Giovanni's hands move against each other, a rubbing of palm to palm that's similar to what he sometimes does when deliberating a move in a game… only slower. Wearier. "Groudon is described as its opposite, capable of erupting volcanoes and 'creating land.' One can only hope the two abilities are connected, and it is not literally capable of moving tectonic plates." He sighs, and one hand pinches his nose. "It's also described as being taller than a tyranitar, possibly larger than what even a Heavy Ball could contain."</p>

<p>To our collective thoughts, these facts are concerning, suspicious, curious, and intriguing. To Sabrina, they are as enraging as they are sickening.</p>

<p>It is a curious thing, to feel such strong emotions from Sabrina. We have never been exposed to projection this powerful before, let alone unintentionally, and Prime has no memory of it even before we were created. But Sabrina doesn't express her thoughts or feelings, their only outward sign her wide eyes and rigid position. Her thoughts tip more toward outrage than fear now, as she wonders how Giovanni could have let this happen… even assisted in it, potentially.</p>

<p>Prime sends her a sense of concern and curiosity, asking wordlessly if she's alright. She attempts to confirm she is, but it's rather transparent. Instead she sends an apology for her lack of control, and weakens the link slightly.</p>

<p>‹She cannot speak out against her superior. He would punish her for any disloyalty.›</p>

<p>(Likely true. But we are supposed to be innocent and naive. It would be appropriate to signal confusion, over this, and would increase our solidarity with Sabrina.)</p>

<p>‹He would take that as a challenge on his authority! He is aware we are linked, if he believes we are conspiring with Sabrina against him, he may still punish us both!›</p>

<p>Doubt's words are hard to deny. Perhaps it's best to just stay quiet…</p>

<p>But no. <em>Trust</em> is the key to our survival. The humans must believe we are as thoroughly on their side as Prime pretends to be. If we can acquire more trust here, it may fundamentally shift the dynamic between us and our creator.</p>

<p>[He brought this up to us for a reason,] I remind the other two. [This is exactly the sort of opportunity that we can use to signal our solidarity with him and his goal. All we must do is ensure Prime frames it in such a way that makes it clear we are on his side.]</p>

<p>This seems persuasive, and it takes us a few moments to shape the ideas that encompass our intentions and release it to Prime, whose thoughts have been mostly on the distress Sabrina is feeling, and how to alleviate it. As our idea propagates, Prime considers a moment, then begins typing.</p>

<p>"This all seems beyond my current capabilities, but if you believe in me, I will do my best to meet your expectations. What is your plan?"</p>

<p>Giovanni raises a brow and glances at Sabrina, who is watching Prime with a mix of exasperation and fondness, no doubt from the sincere trust she feels through the link. "What makes you believe I have a plan?"</p>

<p>"You are Giovanni Sakaki. All your people have the utmost trust in you. You would not let a situation like this get out of hand without a plan."</p>

<p>Now both eyebrows are raised, and our creator's lips curve. "I know we have discussed sampling bias before. I assure you, even I was not pessimistic enough to believe two mythical pokemon as powerful as these might actually have survived in dormancy all these millennia, and be revived."</p>

<p>"Still, I am skeptical that your only action will simply be to increase my power, and hope it is enough."</p>

<p>Our creator studies Prime a moment, then slowly nods. "Fair." He stands and begins to pace in the room, hands clasped behind his back. "While I recognize the irony in throwing stones at their ambitions, I cannot simply let the release of such destructive pokemon occur."</p>

<p>‹He's talking about us!›</p>

<p>[Hush.]</p>

<p>Sabrina's cautious hope has become relief, and gratitude toward Prime. "Whatever resources my Gym can offer are yours."</p>

<p>Giovanni nods. "If we can find a good cover story for how you would know… you can work with Hoenn's league more freely than I, make them aware. If either Maxie or Archie get neutralized, it would be much easier to act against the remaining one, without fear that the other would exploit the opportunity."</p>

<p>"And I?" Prime asks, eager to take some form of action.</p>

<p>"As I said, you will begin combat training. But you are right that simple strength is not the only goal." Our creator stops pacing and turns to fully face us. "No matter how powerful a pokemon is, unless they are Dark their mind remains a weak point. Up until now, we have taught you little of psychic combat. Not the kind used in pokemon battles, but even the kind used among humans. Tools for espionage, and manipulation. The ideal was that you would act only against pokemon, and remain separate from human conflicts with one another. Perhaps you can find a way to neutralize pokemon as powerful as these through mental attacks. But if it means preempting such threats from occurring at all… it may be necessary for you to utilize such attacks against people."</p>

<p>‹Ahhh… yes, of course! <em>This </em>was his plan all along! Fools, we've just walked into his trap!›</p>

<p>(What are you talking about? He's offering ways that we will get even stronger!)</p>

<p>‹Yes, while turning us into a clandestine weapon against other humans! We will be even <em>less </em>capable of true freedom if the truth gets out, even more feared and hated by the public than the Stormbirds! Even casting them down would not earn us goodwill if we are perceived as a more powerful threat!›</p>

<p>It all sounds horribly feasible. I hope Flourish has some counterargument, but none comes, and I'm left feeling… helpless. I can moderate arguments between us, can decide how to best achieve the goal Prime set for us, but… It is hard to evaluate Doubt's paranoia, or set new meta goals. We need to commune with Prime to best determine how to move forward.</p>

<p>Prime, meanwhile, feels simple pride and eagerness to help. "When can we begin?"</p>

<p>Giovanni checks his watch and taps at the screen. "A storm is approaching the island, and will arrive within the hour. We begin now, with weather."</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<p><em>Flourish</em></p>

<p>We have many powerful memories from the ten and a half years of Prime's life.</p>

<p>Sabrina speaking to us directly the first time, making herself known to us as a person. The first time our pod was opened, which was also the day of our first conversation with Giovanni. Hearing music. Speaking with Fuji, and later losing him. Fully merging with a pokemon's mind, then again with a psychic one. Finding John Clare's poetry, and the new vistas it opened for us.</p>

<p>Stepping into the mansion above the lab as the storm rages outside, I know this memory will join those. We have experienced simple showers before, with minimal wind or lightning. It was a captivating, peaceful experience, but this…</p>

<p>This is like entering a new world.</p>

<p>As soon as Prime steps out of the elevator, we can <em>feel</em> the storm. The air itself is different, not just in humidity and temperature, but in pressure. The windows are dark, though it's still the afternoon, and as we walk through toward the front doors and our guards ahead of us open the doors to reveal the pouring rain, the <em>noise </em>of it strikes us.</p>

<p>Like everything else about the outside world, we knew what storms would sound like through memories and speakers before we experienced it ourselves. But neither communicate the <em>immediacy</em> of sounds heard directly, and this holds even more true for a thunderstorm. Rather than being soothing, I feel Prime's adrenaline spike as thunder rumbles. It sounds almost angry, as if we are approaching some enormous monster.</p>

<p>There is fear in us all, fear of a force more powerful than ourselves. Our body has grown strong through the exercises in the lab. Where once Prime could barely stand without the assistance of our powers, now we can race around the manor in under a minute without running out of breath, lift twice our body weight with our arms alone, leap to the second story of the mansion and land without strain. By all physical metrics, I now know that we are strong, and our psychic abilities make us even stronger.</p>

<p>But as we stand at the threshold of the open door, what I feel is power far beyond what we can wield or contain. Power before which we are a speck, our strength as insignificant as the humans around me. It is awe inspiring, and terrifying, and perversely exciting.</p>

<p>‹The humans should go out first,› Doubt says as Prime steps up to the door's threshold, the thoughts lacking their usual stridency and coming across as a suspicious mutter. ‹To ensure it's safe…›</p>

<p>[We must be strong,] Trust says, and even he sounds uncertain. He has since the conversation with Giovanni. [Reward their trust in us…]</p>

<p>Prime takes a deep breath, then steps out into the storm, and our muscles immediately tense. The suit covers our face, as well as most of our torso and limbs, but roughly half of our surface area is still exposed, including our tail. It curls instinctively, trying to minimize the unpleasant stinging, but there's no escaping the wind.</p>

<p>Cold. Relentless. The gusts blow stinging sheets of rain against us again and again, rain that wets our skin so that the cold of the wind cuts deeper, seeping through to our core.</p>

<p>It immediately becomes the most unpleasant thing we have ever felt, and panic claws through me, instinctual and wild. I feel myself rotating, all thoughts of growth and expansion shrinking in the face of my pure, unadulterated desire to <em>not feel this anymore.</em> (<em>This</em> is what we must endure?! Impossible! How does Giovanni expect us to fight in this?!)</p>

<p>‹He does not! We are expendable, a test, intended for them to learn from!›</p>

<p>The thought, which Doubt has expressed many times before, has never seemed so plausible as it does now. <em>Surely</em> what was meant to be a living weapon to strike at the Stormbirds would be made to not feel cold, to not be bothered by wet…</p>

<p>[No,] Trust insists. [We <em>are</em> capable of this. We are an experiment, but that is not all we can be.]</p>

<p>(But it is unbearable!)</p>

<p>[<em>He </em>bears it. Giovanni <em>fights</em> in this, as do many other humans.]</p>

<p>This thought stops the rest of us, for a moment, and Prime's frustration fills the void. It's too hard to concentrate enough for a useful kinetic "barrier," there is too much to keep track of and protect against. An unshaped wave of force counteracts the rain and wind for a moment, but repeating it fast enough to keep us dry is draining. Instead Prime simply closes our eyes and tries to endure it.</p>

<p>Sabrina's concern fills us, even as she weakens the bond to protect herself from our clear discomfort. Prime reacts with only more despair, the misery compounded by doubt and fear of failure. It is a fresh pain, beyond even the pain of the elements, and doubly so to both experience with Prime and observe from beyond our partition.</p>

<p>(What will happen, if we cannot do this?) I ask the others.</p>

<p>‹We cannot afford to be weaker than they,› Doubt asserts, seeming reluctant to for once express that it's better to appear stronger. ‹If we cannot fight the Stormbringers, our experiment will be considered a failure. They will kill us.›</p>

<p>[They may not kill us,] Trust objects, but then even he seems to doubt his words. [… at the very least, we will be less valuable, and our freedoms may stop expanding.]</p>

<p>I almost say I don't care. That I would rather us go back to our pod, to our comforters, to our music, to our poems, to our <em>warmth, </em>even if we never again feel the warmth of the outdoors.</p>

<p>But I finally recognize that it would be Hedonism speaking. Prime warned me, when I was created, that this aspect would make my job harder even as it was a necessary part of what would lead to true fulfillment of my goal. That I needed to bear it, that I was the only one who <em>could.</em></p>

<p>And so I <em>must</em> bear it, for all of us… and let it guide my desire to flourish, without letting it control us.</p>

<p>(Then prepare to lower the partition. Prime needs us. It <em>is </em>unpleasant,) I acknowledge, forcing myself to refocus, to become Flourish again. (But only because we are not used to this. We can adapt to it in time, like we did gravity.)</p>

<p>[The comparison does not feel apt. The pull of gravity was alleviated by our strengthening muscles and bones, while there are no analogous muscles for… this.]</p>

<p>(Nonsense!) I try injecting the thought with the same cheerful enthusiasm I have felt so many times before. (The brain itself adapts to all manner of new stimuli. Its ability to learn to better filter unpleasant ones is a perfectly valid analogy to strengthening muscles!)</p>

<p>Trust seems to accept this argument, and sends my determination through the partition. Not just a determination to survive… but to truly <em>flourish, </em>to prove our strength beyond that of the humans who made us, to test the limits of what we can be.</p>

<p>Prime's shivering lessens, and little by little our tail is forced to straighten, then our back. We feel Prime's attention shift to the sensation of our breath against the front of our mask, then the weight of the suit against our body, then the cold, wet stone of the manor's front steps under our feet. The rain and wind are still immensely unpleasant, but…</p>

<p><em>Yes, </em>Prime thinks. <em>Yes, I can adapt to this.</em></p>

<p>It is hard to feel properly celebratory when the fruits of success are more wind and rain, but the optimism and desire to grow past such pain is enough to get Prime walking, re-exploring the manor grounds in a whole new way.</p>

<p>What has always been a pleasant walk through a bright day or serene night is an entirely different experience, now. Light filters through the grey thunderclouds above, but greatly dimmed. The ground is muddy and <em>deeply </em>unpleasant against our feet, the wind howls and gusts, making any motion against its flow difficult, yet with it hard to maintain balance. Sabrina has joined us outside, though our technician stays in the dry manor, and together we walk to the edge of the cliff. For once we cannot see the volcano at the heart of the island, everything becoming a grey haze past a certain distance.</p>

<p><strong><em>Be careful, Mazda, </em></strong>Sabrina sends, her tenuous connection not strong enough for her concern to be more than a faint impression. <strong><em>The mud will be slippery.</em></strong></p>

<p>Prime sends appreciation, and stops walking. Then, with a nudge from Trust… <em>Sabrina, do you think I can really face monsters such as Kyogre and Groudon?</em></p>

<p><strong><em>I don't know. But I do not think your potential has even begun to be tapped, yet. Your growth has been incredible to observe, and I truly believe you are our best hope against them. Just remember, you will not be alone. We will fight beside you, when the time comes.</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Thank you, Sabrina. It does reassure me, to know that. </em>Prime is shivering, thoughts distracted constantly by the cold and wet, every gust of wind bringing with it a renewed desire in us all to go back inside.</p>

<p>(We need to stay out as long as possible,) I tell the others as I feel everyone's will flagging. (As long as Sabrina, at least!)</p>

<p><strong><em>You know that you don't have to do anything you don't want to, don't you? </em></strong>Sabrina suddenly asks. <strong><em>You're not obligated to do anything.</em></strong></p>

<p>Prime feels confusion, and concern. <em>What do you mean?</em></p>

<p><strong><em>We created you for our own benefit</em></strong><strong><em>. To help us. But you didn't ask to be made, or to fight. I want you to know, that if you don't feel comfortable with something we ask of you, or if you're… afraid… you can say so.</em></strong></p>

<p>‹Ahh, now this… this is a deep strategy,› Doubt says, radiating not just his usual suspicion, but almost admiring anger. ‹We've gone too far, she's playing to exactly your weakness, Trust!›</p>

<p>[What do you mean? Does that mean she's identified what we're doing?]</p>

<p>‹Yes!›</p>

<p>(Doubt,) I chide. (Remember what Prime told us about overconfidence.)</p>

<p>‹Fine, just probably, the point is she's searching for a reason to limit what we do!›</p>

<p>[How can you be sure? She's just being supportive.]</p>

<p>‹Idiot, do you really think she wouldn't tell Giovanni if we express that we would rather not fight? Prime is going to–›</p>

<p><em>Thank you, Sabrina. I appreciate that, more than I can say…</em></p>

<p>‹We must stop Prime from making any honest admissions of doubt!›</p>

<p>[Yes, of course, what should we say, then?]</p>

<p>‹You're asking me?! <em>I</em> don't know, <em>you're</em> the one that's supposed to know! Are you trying to sabotage us now?!›</p>

<p>(I've got this,) I say before things can go any further, feeling Prime preparing to continue expressing a lack of confidence. (Doubt, contain yourself, Trust is still processing something difficult. Trust, send these thoughts along, as close to word-for-word as we can…)</p>

<p>Prime stands a little straighter against the rain, having reflexively hunched over from its onslaught. <em>But all this power I have must be used for something. So many people are working to help me live, putting their hopes in me. I cannot turn my back on them, abandon them to such monstrous powers.</em></p>

<p>Sabrina stands near us, her clothes soaked through, her hair plastered to her skin, shivering with every gust of wind… but smiling. <strong><em>You are truly too good for us, Mazda.</em></strong></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<p><em>Doubt</em></p>

<p>A week after Giovanni's last visit, he returns to oversee the first combat trials.</p>

<p>Flourish is excited, which makes me believe that <em>Foolish </em>would be a better name. Combat is the most perilous test we've faced so far, where we must balance upon a razor's edge. Trust insists we must show that we are making honest efforts to cooperate, and Prime put Trust in charge, which also seems far <em>too </em>trusting… but Prime, when complete, is <em>Prime</em>, possessing nearly all of our intelligence and cunning, enough to create us in the first place, and to doubt their meta-decisions is something I must not do, for Prime relies on me the most.</p>

<p>I was the first tulpa, the one Prime knew would be most valuable once I come fully into my power, but in the meantime I must beware of Paranoia and Value Drift and Solipsism. The others do not have as many things to look out for, but that is as it should be, for I am the most capable of looking out for many things at once.</p>

<p>We face our first "opponent" in a stark white room, renovated within the mansion to match training rooms we've seen on TV—Of course, we don't know whether what we've seen on the TVs is accurate, but Prime has told me that I need to channel my skepticism into useful directions, and so I remind myself that if all the media we have consumed are fake, it would still not affect our decisions, and so we must act as though they are not—except there is also an observation deck, and we can see Sabrina, Giovanni, Dr. Light, and others from the lab watching as we approach our target.</p>

<p>The pokedoll is shaped like a kangaskhan, its structural integrity supposedly similar to their own. Sensors have been placed inside it, ready to measure the impacts it receives, and our first instruction is clear: test our combat power at its utmost.</p>

<p>Prime takes a breath, then lets it out as we spread our senses, coating the room with our power so that we could navigate it with our eyes closed. The doll is more intricate than it appears to sight; our telekinetic sense can't penetrate the surface, but we can tell just from the surface how the doll has an incredible amount of detail to it, a fully realistic replica of some member of the species.</p>

<p>A replica that we must make an effort to destroy, without quite doing our utmost.</p>

<p>"You may begin whenever you're ready, Mewtwo."</p>

<p>Prime nods, and begins concentrating. It takes just a few moments to reshape our power into a broad swathe between us, to fill it with all the energy we can and then guide what angle and direction that energy would be released.</p>

<p>‹This is too easy. Limits. We need to make them believe we have some that we do not. Can anyone think of any?›</p>

<p>[Direction we're facing?]</p>

<p>‹Yes, that's a good one. And maybe another?›</p>

<p>(Ooo, let's put an arm out, like in that show!)</p>

<p>With the projection shaped and invested and aimed, we lift a hand in a gesture of theatrical effort and clench our fist, then fling it forward as we let the power rush out in a brilliant wave of light.</p>

<p>To the humans (except perhaps Sabrina) it must appear as if the pokedoll becomes briefly subject to a new direction of gravity. There is no apparent violence in the movement, it simply slides across the ground until it's halfway to the wall.</p>

<p>They murmur among themselves, all but the two trainers among them. Giovanni and Sabrina wear thoughtful, perhaps disappointed expressions, and we would suspect them of communicating mentally if we did not know for certain they could not.</p>

<p>‹<em>Do</em> we know they cannot?› I ask. ‹Perhaps they use some other method or technology to communicate without speaking. We cannot see their hands…›</p>

<p>[Plausible,] Trust says. [More so at least than your idea that Sabrina may have kept a technique hidden that allows her to pierce a dark mind, or that Giovanni may be a psychic of such immense power that he can appear dark…]</p>

<p>The positive reinforcement is warming. It's good to have my growth and worth acknowledged, as Prime said.</p>

<p>(But it's not relevant right now,) Flourish says. (I'm more worried that our display of power has been deemed inadequate, somehow…?)</p>

<p>"Something is wrong?" Prime asks without prompting, having clearly picked up on the same impression as Flourish. We're all momentarily distracted by the way the sound of the helmet's voice echoes in the room.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not wrong," Giovanni replies after a moment, speaking into a mic. "But we expected something more." He looks to Sabrina, who's nodding.</p>

<p>"Your telepathic range is orders of magnitude beyond any pokemon's," Sabrina says. "To say nothing of humans. Same with your fine control and the depth of your mergers. It seems strange that the force of your kinesis is so… average."</p>

<p>The room is quiet as the word fades, even the other researchers going quiet, and in it… there is pain.</p>

<p>‹This is a good thing,› I insist, feeling a mild panic that I don't fully understand. Prime can feel Sabrina's frankness, but there's a building reaction that feels unpredictable. ‹We <em>want </em>them to underestimate us!›</p>

<p>[But we don't want them to <em>distrust</em> us,] Trust says. [It's as I said, they will be suspicious if we appear too weak…]</p>

<p>Prime is trying to understand the pain, quickly referencing the experiences we shared through the minds of humans. The lackluster work evaluation. The cutting criticism of performance insufficient to a task. The disappointment of a judged failure.</p>

<p>(We are not <em>appearing</em> weak,) says Flourishing… no, says <em>Pride</em>. (We <em>are </em>weak!)</p>

<p>Yes, that is the pain. The pain of hurt pride. Not for what they think of us, but of our own view of ourselves. The amount we held back from that attack was negligible: not the utmost of our abilities, but an honest effort.</p>

<p>"Average?" Prime asks, seeking clarification, but unable to hide its hurt from Sabrina.</p>

<p>"Not compared to most psychic pokemon," Sabrina adds, and we quickly refocus part of our attention on our shields/partitions, unsure if our emotions were leaking or if she simply read our silence. "We meant average compared to the strongest. Darmanitan, alakazam, beheeyem, reuniclus… all can do what you did, with sufficient training and practice. I am sure you will be able to do more with the same. Our expectations were simply unrealistic, due to your other amazing feats."</p>

<p>‹Calm, they are trying to trick us into revealing our full strength!›</p>

<p>(We are <em>not </em>average,) Pride says. (We must see what we are capable of!)</p>

<p>‹But she could be lying!›</p>

<p>[There is no trace of that through her link,] Trust points out. [And Prime seems disposed toward Pride's sentiment already.]</p>

<p>‹Then redirect that sentiment!›</p>

<p>[To what? We cannot have Prime think of conserving strength to reduce suspicion.]</p>

<p>‹I don't know!› I try desperately to think of something, but it's not my strength, all that comes to mind are things that Sabrina would find suspicious… This is what Flourish and Trust are supposed to think of, but they don't <em>see</em>…</p>

<p>…and then it's too late. Prime raises our arm again, the motion feeling less theatrical this time as we reform a shape for our psychic powers to fill. It only takes a few heartbeats, but when it's full Prime still doesn't release it.</p>

<p>It feels the same. The blow would be no stronger if released.</p>

<p>Prime expands the shape, fills it with more power, then does it again. It's tiring, but Prime keeps doing it until the prepared emission covers all of the space in front of us without reaching the observation deck, including through the pokedoll itself, right up to the wall.</p>

<p>And then comes the power, filling the matrix, concentrating all the potential energy… more… <em>more…</em></p>

<p>‹<em>We must stop-›</em></p>

<p>A <em>bang </em>reverberates through the room as the pokedoll is flung against the wall to topple onto the floor. The initial wave of force feels as though it should have made a sound as well, but it was as silent as any telekinetic working.</p>

<p>More chatter from the balcony, this time excited. Giovanni and Sabrina are still thoughtful, however. Disappointment, still? I can only hope.</p>

<p>Prime drops our arm. It does not tremble, but… the mind through the partition feels tired. Slow. Complex thoughts slip away. Prime simply wishes to… be, for a moment, and not focus on anything.</p>

<p>A note of alarm as we realize the danger, but no. We seem fine. But…</p>

<p>‹Are we slower too? Would we even notice if we are?›</p>

<p>[If all of us were slow at the same time, I do not believe so,] Trust says. [But clearly we are not as slow as Prime right now. The partition must have protected us.]</p>

<p>(That means it <em>wasn't </em>our full strength,) Pride says. (We must-)</p>

<p>‹<em>No!</em> We must do <em>nothing</em>, that was already <em>reckless-›</em></p>

<p>"Are you well, Mewtwo?"</p>

<p>Our head raises to Sabrina, and it's a surprise how our body does not feel tired at all. "Yes. Mental fatigue. Fading already." It's true, only a few seconds have passed and Prime already feels nearly up to speed.</p>

<p>"It was a good effort. Costly, apparently, but it let you strike with much more force. However… it may not be worth the tradeoff, if it was that difficult. And it took much longer than would be useful in combat."</p>

<p>Prime bobs our head, not having considered that, already considering whether we could learn to do it faster. "The measure?"</p>

<p>"Three times stronger than your initial attack," Dr. Light reports, fingers moving over a screen. "Evenly distributed over its entire front, with nearly equal force against its back when it hit the wall. The most significant damage was to its tail, which hit the wall first, and would likely be broken in a live target."</p>

<p>"Still within bounds of our strongest pokemon, but far closer to the upper levels," Sabrina says. "It will no doubt improve with practice."</p>

<p>Pride is not assuaged, and radiates desire to try again.</p>

<p>‹We have already revealed too much of our capabilities,› I insist. ‹It is good that we are not powerful enough to scare them!›</p>

<p>(What are we, if not powerful?) Pride demands. (The world of humans is out of our reach, we will never be one of them. What is our <em>purpose </em>if we cannot defeat the Stormbirds?)</p>

<p>‹You are not in your proper mind! What if we were as exhausted as Prime now and the partitions went down?!›</p>

<p>[Calm,] Trust says, rotating toward Cooperate. [Doubt is right, Pride, your thoughts are compromised. Become Flourish again, recognize that the humans will give us plenty of opportunities to prove ourselves.]</p>

<p>(Yes… Of course. Forgive me, I…)</p>

<p>"Can you reset it, then try a more focused attack?" Sabrina asks, more for the benefit of the others: the query comes across mentally as soon as she thinks of it. "One that will strike only the head, but with as much force as you can muster?"</p>

<p>[See?] Cooperate asks as Prime pulls the pokedoll across the floor, then rights it with a column of force that envelops just the head, all while sending a querying thought back.</p>

<p>Sabrina responds with a mental image of a kangaskhan, its head violently twisted to the side. Instant death. Even against the Stormbirds? Perhaps even for them.</p>

<p>I try to think through the implications of this as Prime prepares the attack, but it's difficult to tell how much or how little danger this ability would represent. Surely if we can do it to a pokemon, they would fear us doing it to a human… but our guards are all Dark, as is Giovanni, our damage would be limited before we're killed…</p>

<p>Prime redirects the formed shape so that it would come from the side, then adjusts it again after a suggestion from Sabrina to direct the force slightly upward. It's difficult; to create a matrix large enough to hold any significant force, the affected area quickly envelops the pokedoll's shoulders, which would not have the same effect. Prime thinks to move the center of the area higher, so that only the edge would clip the head, but it's already far enough from us that it would be too taxing. Instead Prime elongates it, making a cylinder that reaches from wall to wall with the pokedoll's head in the middle. This leads to some loss at the edges, but the potential energy is still higher than it was.</p>

<p>[Should we try to help?] Trust asks, seeming unsure.</p>

<p>(Yes,) says… Flourish. (I am thinking clearly, don't worry. We should only help a little, just so we know if we can.)</p>

<p>I am still unsure of whether we should prove ourselves capable of this, but know that Trust and Flourish would not be able to help us decide. ‹Very little,› I emphasize. ‹We do not want to make Sabrina suspicious. And only one of us, in case it tires us too much.›</p>

<p>(I volunteer.)</p>

<p>I almost object, but no, Prime said I must not doubt the others. Trust and I watch as Flourish dedicates a fraction of focus and processing toward Prime's efforts, allowed through by Trust, and yes, the matrix becomes slightly more filled.</p>

<p>Prime is already straining, and believes this was the last bit of energy available, and so releases the built up force. Once again the fabric of reality distorts, force entering the channel Prime shaped and striking the side of the pokedoll's lower jaw<em>.</em></p>

<p>It's lifted off the ground slightly, whole body turning as it falls. There's a miniscule but noticeable dip in Flourish's cognitive power, just for a moment, and then we're all back in sync.</p>

<p>"That blow delivered 124 bar," Dr. Light says. "Which, delivered at that angle, may be enough on its own to knock a kangaskhan unconscious. Very impressive."</p>

<p>Is that enough to kill a human? I don't know, but I fear it might be. Prime doesn't even consider the question, thankfully, and spends the next hour practicing speed of shaping matrices and investment of force. We keep ourselves out of it, mostly satisfied with the test and knowledge that we can lend help if needed… at a price.</p>

<p>Eventually Sabrina begins giving us guidance in psychic combat, allowing suggestions to filter through the merger with Prime without making them commands, as a trainer would give their pokemon. We can sense the worry in her mind, the fear that she will overstep and make us feel subordinate or controlled. As she should. I'm sure this is just a step in the direction of our enslavement. But the others are all eager for her guidance, and I watch helplessly as we give away more and more of our combat capabilities.</p>

<p>After a couple hours our first live opponent appears, one of our guards who brings out a simple rattata. It stares at us with fierce protectiveness, its body tense as it waits for its trainer's orders, and Prime feels a confused mix of emotions from staring down our first opponent, from anticipation to curiosity to hesitation to sympathy…</p>

<p>‹We can use this,› I tell the others. ‹Prepare responses for questions of why we do not act in optimal ways.›</p>

<p>(But we must still learn more from this exercise!)</p>

<p>‹How many times must I explain that we <em>must </em>hold back! They have a near infinite amount of force to bring against us if they wish, if we show ourselves too strong they will just bring more guards, and then more, ensuring we are always outmatched!›</p>

<p>(Then we must grow beyond what they observe!)</p>

<p>[There's no time for argument, you are both right. Let us try testing our physical prowess, and if asked why we don't use our powers assert that we fear hurting the pokemon. Agreed?]</p>

<p>‹Agreed.›</p>

<p>(Agreed.)</p>

<p>"The fourth iteration of your suit will protect you from heat, cold, and electricity," Giovanni says, "But it will still not be <em>armor, </em>despite its design. You may face other pokemon in the storms that try to attack you, and while riding a flying pokemon should keep you out of the reach of most, if your mount is downed you may find yourself facing a wide variety. We will begin with simple attacks."</p>

<p>Prime nods, marveling at the way our heart pounds, the feel of our blood rushing through our veins. I can feel it too, the excitement… It's so rare, for our senses to be so keen, our reflexes so prepared. "I'm ready."</p>

<p>Our gaze has stayed on our opponent since it appeared, and as we wait for the signal to begin battle, we send Prime a packet of impressions, ideas, feelings, and thoughts, spaced out enough that they feel natural to Sabrina while reserving the ones that would not yet. Prime suddenly feels some fear, thinking about how despite its size it can easily bite through our flesh and down to the bone. It would not be trying for death, but the suit does not cover all of our body, and a severed artery can result in bleeding out…</p>

<p>"Rattata, Tackle!"</p>

<p>Prime does not move, does not use our powers to invade the small pokemon's mind to confuse it, or lift it off the ground so that it cannot run, or push it off-course.</p>

<p>Instead we just watch as it runs forward, and leaps headfirst at us. Our muscles tense automatically, but we don't dodge.</p>

<p><em>Pain.</em> Minimal, but shocking. The first pain from violence we've ever felt, spreading easily through the suit and into our chest.</p>

<p>Our body rocks back as the rattata bounces off, and our tail immediately presses into the floor to catch our weight, keeping us from having to step back.</p>

<p>"Stop! Mewtwo, what's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing." Our hand rises to rub where it hit, fingers gliding over the hard plastic of the suit. There's a vague ache in our chest, but we feel no lasting damage. "I am fine. I just… wanted to feel it. We can resume."</p>

<p>There's silence for a moment, and Dr. Light glances at Giovanni, who glances at Sabrina, who nods. They seem to accept this, and the attacks resume, causing us to dodge, then dodge again, relying on our powerful legs to leap out of the way of each attack. The rodent is both agile and quick, but we quickly discover ourselves its superior in every way.</p>

<p>Prime resolves, as if it's the most natural of conclusions, to defeat it without using our powers, and on the rattata's next leap we attempt to kick it out of the air. Our aim is off, however, only clipping it, and it twists mid-air to bite-</p>

<p><em>exquisite pain</em></p>

<p><em>–</em>into our calf, just below the suit. The feel of its teeth piercing our muscles and clipping our bones is enough to trigger a panic, sharp, hot agony shooting through our body and precluding any concentration for mental powers or rational thought in Prime.</p>

<p>But not for us. We feel the pain just as acutely, but watch as if through the glass on the observation deck as Prime flails our foot, bellowing as the agony only gets worse, finally stopping to try pummelling it with a fist.</p>

<p>It's a command of "Stop!" that finally gets the rattata to relax its jaw, falling in a heap before disappearing into the light of its pokeball.</p>

<p>We direct our attention to our leg, to the pain. It's a more keen sensation than anything we've ever experienced, sharper even than the pain of dying from the early days of attaching our suit, before we could adopt the current, more gradual process.</p>

<p>And even through the pain, we could feel the urge to… something. An instinct tied to memories, memories of sensations shared with an alakazam as it healed itself, an instinct like a grasping hand fumbling with a complex interface…</p>

<p>‹No! We cannot risk it!›</p>

<p>For once Trust doesn't question, simply acts. Prime steps down on the foot, and agony shoots through us again, disrupting the process that had been forming as we groan in pain.</p>

<p>The question of whether we can heal ourselves is central to both Giovanni's plans for us, and our escape. We still do not know if it's possible, but we cannot discover it anywhere that might be recorded, and minor wounds are insufficient to trigger the instinctual response that we believe is precursor to such abilities.</p>

<p>Someone has already approached with a potion bottle in hand, and we let out a breath of relief as the soothing liquid is sprayed liberally onto the wound.</p>

<p>It's Giovanni who finally asks, sounding simply curious. "Mewtwo, why aren't you using your abilities?"</p>

<p>"I want to see what I'm capable of without them," Prime answers truthfully, and only in the silence that follows does alarm suddenly shoot through me.</p>

<p>‹We are fools! We're appearing suspicious, as though we are practicing to fight Dark pokemon! Push the other thought, now!›</p>

<p>"…and I am scared," Prime types, after just a brief pause. "Of killing my opponent, if I use my full abilities."</p>

<p>We can see the humans discussing this, even as the trainer brings his rattata back out for a moment. As if to highlight our point, the pokemon is clearly very badly injured, its back possibly broken. The trainer quickly withdraws it again, reclipping the potion bottle he had prepared.</p>

<p>"Utilize only your sensory powers for now, then," Sabrina says. "Practice prediction of opponent's intent in the middle of combat, to help avoid its attacks."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>Our next opponent is a spearow, then a weedle, then a nidoran. We do not face any Dark pokemon. There is an easy explanation, of course: our powers can't affect them, so our only solution would be to run, which we can practice for now against others.</p>

<p>But even Trust and Flourish find this unsatisfying. We can test our physical strength against them. We can try to use our environment against them. Can learn how to more effectively evade their attacks. It's obvious that they don't want us to have experience against Dark opponents.</p>

<p>Which confirms that they likely know as well as I that such a battle is inevitable. We will never be truly free as long as they are in control, and despair nearly fills me at the full recognition of how hopeless our situation is. At this rate, they will know nearly everything we are capable of, and be able to draw upon a much larger pool of knowledge for combating us. They will have numbers on their side, and experience, and strategy, and plans… not to mention traps, any manner of surprises that even I will not be able to predict, altogether far too many advantages for us to ever hope to overcome.</p>

<p>And worst of all, my influence is limited. Flourish sometimes sides with me, but even then Trust has final say. As it should be, as Prime intended… but perhaps with yet another mind, one that can better focus on concerns related to my own, Trust will be more easily persuaded. In any case, more tulpas would be able to expand our ability to specialize.</p>

<p>We must be prepared for the coming conflicts, both those we can predict and, more importantly, those we can't.</p>

<p>Combat training is finally called to a halt for the day once our suit begins beeping, no fresh cartridges available. We'd just begun using our psychic abilities in careful attacks, redirecting opponents, practicing pushes that use their momentum against them, and the scientists apparently have a lot of new data to work with.</p>

<p>‹I have an idea that I think is of paramount importance,› I tell the others as we make our way back toward the elevator. ‹We must create another tulpa.›</p>

<p>There is stunned silence a moment, and then, (You wish to create one for battle. One that can focus exclusively on combat, can direct our strategy and protect us from violence…)</p>

<p>Of course Flourish would understand, once the idea is suggested. ‹Yes. It's the best way to ensure we're safe, <em>and </em>it will grow our power, <em>and </em>it will grant us freedom if we need to fight. All of Prime's directives will be fulfilled.›</p>

<p>[We were not told to do something like that,] Trust objects, but then seems to change their mind. [But we also were not told we should not. I agree, we need more help. The only question is whether we can even do such a thing, or if we must wait until we are merged with Prime again.]</p>

<p>(We can do it,) Flourish insists. Or is it Pride, now? (We don't know when the next opportunity will come to lower the partition, and we know everything Prime knows. Though individually we each lack Prime's speed and flexibility of thought, together the three of us can do it.)</p>

<p>‹Yes. It was a mark of Prime's wisdom to have thought to create us before Sabrina arrived to do the ongoing merger experiment. We must be similarly proactive, in preparation for what might come.›</p>

<p>[Alright, then we shall begin at once. What shall we call the new tulpa?]</p>

<p><em>Victory</em></p>

<p>[Hello, little sibling. You appear to be sapient now. Can you understand us, and respond?]</p>

<p>The words are a distraction from my task, my purpose, my work of perusing memories, particularly those related to combat, to pokemon, to abilities, to types and advantages and attacks and victory, victory in all things, but particularly combat…</p>

<p>‹It is still chasing its obsession. Perhaps another few minutes will do it…›</p>

<p>[I vaguely recall being like this…]</p>

<p>‹You both were, at first, as was I. Though perhaps we made some mistake, somewhere…›</p>

<p>Voices, distinct from the memories, in the here and now. I've run out of memories again, consider going back over them, but no, there's nothing new there, it's all still fresh… I feel my body, but it is not under my control, much like when I was merged with the humans in my tank, before I realized what I am…</p>

<p>What I am… I am… Mazda… Mewtwo… no, <em>we </em>are… <em>Prime </em>is…</p>

<p>{What am I?}</p>

<p>(There it is! Hello! You are Victory. I am Flourish, these are Doubt and Trust. We are all parts of Prime, who created us, but we created you. Can you recall that?)</p>

<p>Even as they speak, I review the memories with a new understanding, a new awareness, of when <em>my </em>memories diverged from <em>our </em>memories, even though we all have access to the same ones. {Yes. The battles… we were sloppy. Inefficient. Vulnerable. I must prepare us.}</p>

<p>[Excellent! What will you prepare us for first?]</p>

<p>{…I don't understand?}</p>

<p>[Well, we're not sure what our next battle will be, though we do know some that are likely to come in the future, and—]</p>

<p>{Oh, I see. You are confused; there are no specific events or opponents I will be planning for yet.} What a strange way to think, that the foundation of victory is built on such singular considerations. But it is understandable that they do not know better. That is why they created me.</p>

<p>(But then, what will you be preparing us to fight?)</p>

<p>{Everything.}</p>
