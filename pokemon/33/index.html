            <div class="chapter-content">
<p><em>The coliseum was colder than she imagined, colder than she thought she could endure. Hail pelted her thick coat and bounced off hastily donned goggles. Harsh winds tore words from lips made numb by their assault. The metal of her pokeballs bit at her fingers with icy teeth. And all the while, she grinned until her cheeks felt frozen in their new position.</em></p>

<p><em>She had thought she was ready. She had thought she was prepared for any obstacle, any twist.</em></p>

<p><em>She never imagined that Elite Lorelei would schedule their Challenge match during a blizzard, on top of an </em>indoor glacier.</p>

<p><em>Misty had never felt so alive.</em></p>

<p>"<em>Remember, you may forfeit at any time," Lorelei said in her ear before the battle began. "I will not call the match if one of your pokemon is killed."</em></p>

<p><em>Misty responded by sending her poliwrath out to pummel the Elite's opening cloyster. Its shell was hard as steel, but just as vulnerable to her pokemon's precise, powerful strikes. Her poliwrath shrugged off its returned attacks and eventually took it down, which began a flurry of swaps and trades. A jynx took down her poliwrath with a mental blast, then got felled itself by Misty's jellicent. Lorelei sent out a weavile, but Misty was ready with the withdraw this time. Wishing she still had her poliwrath, Misty sent her blastoise out to tank the sweeper. Her pokemon was able to hold its own for a while, unable to land a solid blow but protected by its thick shell, but the hailstorm was slowly wearing it down, and Misty finally ordered a Body Slam to try and catch the weavile by surprise.</em></p>

<p><em>Her pokemon fell onto all fours and thrust itself forward like a battering ram, but slipped on the ice of the glacier and veered a bit to the side. The weavile nimbly flipped itself out of the way, then dashed in for another attack</em><em>—</em></p>

<p><em>—</em><em>until her blastoise spun on its belly and aimed a cannon right at it for a full on Hydro Pump.</em></p>

<p><em>Lorelei didn't miss a beat, and sent a lapras out that took her blastoise down with a thunderbolt. Misty quickly sent out her starter and lifelong friend, Celest. She grinned as her starmie easily outsped the lapras and hit it with psychic blasts until it was withdrawn, Recovering to heal from the returned electric attacks.</em></p>

<p><em>Her first Challenge against the Elite Four, and she was already ahead of the game, with four pokemon against Lorelei's remaining three. Lorelei may have been a master of Ice pokemon, but Misty had always favored Water types herself, and was more than prepared for the environment and matchup.</em></p>

<p><em>A shard of hail slid down her neck, making her shudder and chilling her overconfidence. She mentally directed Celest into the water around them, then linked their minds. Years of training with her starmie allowed her to seamlessly interpret the pokemon's bizarre senses and alien thoughts. If Lorelei sent out a non-aquatic pokemon, Celest could do hit and runs attacks from the safety of the water, and if the Elite sent out an aquatic pokemon she wouldn't be able to follow the battle or command her pokemon as well as Misty. With a mental nudge, Celest began rotating around the glacier at high speed as the two surveyed their surroundings through the starmie's psychic field and waited for Lorelei's next move.</em></p>

<p><em>Lorelei lifted an aquascope from behind her platform walls and walked to the edge of the ice before sending her dewgong into it. She sent the long metal pole of the scope into the water and began fiddling with the controls, moving the camera at its bottom to follow the action as she began sending commands to her pokemon through high frequency clicks.</em></p>

<p>So much for that idea<em>, Misty thought as she hastily ordered her pokemon to construct a Light Screen. Dewgong's Water and Ice attacks would be ineffective against Celest, whose ability to naturally cure status effects would help in the outside chance that she was frozen, but the dewgong's Signal Beam would be especially effective against the psychic starfish.</em></p>

<p><em>Instead the dewgong thrust itself at Celest horn first. Misty gasped and doubled over in pain as they were hit by three hundred pounds of blubber sheathed muscle. She quickly commanded Celest to construct a kinetic Barrier around itself as she slowly straightened. Her starmie wouldn't be able to take another hit like that: she hadn't expected Lorelei to train her dewgong as a physical attacker, and now the tempo of the battle was on the Elite's side.</em></p>

<p><em>The dewgong hammered Celest again, but its attack was dampened by the Barrier, and Celest just barely clung onto consciousness. Misty ordered Celest to Recover, and her torn flesh began to close and heal, just a hair faster than Lorelei could undo with the next attack. She kept up the assault regardless, and Misty kept Celest in recovery mode, bearing the shared pain through gritted teeth. Once Celest was fully healed she would be strong enough to take a couple hits in a row as she struck back</em><em>—</em></p>

<p><em>Misty felt Celest's Light Screen fading and saw the trap a second before it was sprung. A second was enough time to react, enough time to command Celest at the speed-of-thought to stop healing and refresh the Light Screen. But with either action equally likely to end in ruin, indecision decided for her.</em></p>

<p><em>The Light Screen faded just as Celest finished fully recovering, and in that instant a new pitch of clicks spread through the water. The dewgong blasted Celest with a beam of discordant sound, causing Misty to clutch at her head as the psychic connection broke. She blinked spots out of her eyes as she tried to fight down her panic. Celest was down there, alone and injured… she reached out with her mind to try and re-establish a connection, but sensed nothing but pain and confusion from her starmie.</em></p>

<p><em>Misty still had three other pokemon. She could accept the loss of Celest and still use her next three to try for a victory. But that would mean letting her starter stay down there and get pummeled into unconsciousness, or worse</em><em>—</em></p>

<p>"<em>I forfeit!" she yelled, and within seconds the machines generating the hailstorm shut down as the audience filled the stadium with noise. Misty rushed to the edge of the glacier, stripping off anything water sensitive and taking out her headset before diving into the icy water. She kicked down until she spotted Celest and unclipped its diveball to return it.</em></p>

<p><em>As she kicked back to the surface and climbed onto the glacier, she knew her attempts at becoming Champion were done. Years spent preparing and she had choked in the very first match against the League, had thrown the battle rather than risk harm to her pokemon. Someone so soft could never be Champion. Her hand caressed Celest's cold ball as she walked to the bridge leading off the glacier, chin held high for the cameras as her spirit withered within her.</em></p>

<p><em>Lorelei found her</em><em> sitting alone outside the Indigo Plateau compound. Misty didn't know how, didn't question it. She simply continued staring up at the stars as the Elite sat on the bench beside her. They shared a silent handful of minutes before the older woman spoke.</em></p>

<p>"<em>You did a noble thing in there. I hope you're not still beating yourself up over it."</em></p>

<p><em>Misty didn't respond, not trusting her voice. Pity was something she wasn't sure she could take right now, though she wasn't sensing any from the surface of Lorelei's thoughts. The woman's mind was tranquil as a falling snowflake.</em></p>

<p><em>"I've been following your trainer profile for a while, you know."</em></p>

<p><em>That got her attention. "I never saw</em><em>—</em><em>" Misty stopped herself. Of course Champions and The Four would use fake accounts to follow random trainers. She found herself blushing at the thought of an Elite spending time personally watching her journey, and cursed her weakness for the dozenth time.</em></p>

<p><em>Lorelei smiled, far warmer than any she showed in the arena. "You have a good heart. A good head, too. That defense of Cerulean Bay? Masterful."</em></p>

<p>"<em>That was... a group effort."</em></p>

<p>"<em>As far as the media portrayed it, yes, but those with the proper channels can learn more personal stories. From my understanding, everyone on the north coast of the city owes their life to you."</em></p>

<p><em>Misty's face was red as her hair now, and she knew it was ruining her attempt to glare at Lorelei. "Do you give this pep talk to all the failed challengers?"</em></p>

<p>"<em>Just the ones I think have potential."</em></p>

<p>"<em>Potential for what?" She can't quite bring herself to ask: Champion?</em></p>

<p>"<em>To make a difference."</em></p>

<p><em>Misty frowned. "I appreciate the vote of confidence, but I wasn't about to throw myself off a cliff or become a hermit or anything."</em></p>

<p><em>Lorelei shook her head. "Not good enough. By this time next year, if you're not someone's Second or a Director for CoRRNet, I'll be very disappointed."</em></p>

<p><em>Misty was ready to get pissed again, but the words stuck in her throat. Gym Second? It's not that she never considered it, but she's not Leader material. She has no deep ties to any communities, never joined a Gym… hell, she spent half of her journey travelling alone because she preferred it to being around others. "Where would I…?"</em></p>

<p><em>The Elite stretched and got to her feet. "That's up to you, dear. I just wanted to make sure you don't waste a single day stuck on this. You had to come here. And you had to lose. To learn something about yourself, down to your core. And to find something new to strive for. That was part of your journey, not the end of it."</em></p>

<p><em>Misty hesitated a moment, then nodded. "Yeah, I get that. I… thank you, Elite."</em></p>

<p>"<em>Call me Lorelei."</em></p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />

<p>The crowd erupts in cheers as Misty's wartortle is knocked out. "Nice job," she says into her mic with a grin, then switches its output to the stadium speakers as she withdraws her pokemon. "Well done, Challenger. I only have three pokemon left, which means we're entering our Lightning Round. What do you say to picking up the pace a bit?"</p>

<p>The young woman on the opposite end of the arena leans against the railing of her platform. "I remain ready to beat you at twice the speed, Leader, or even thrice it if you'd like."</p>

<p>The audience gives a collective "oooh" as Misty laughs. She likes this Challenger. In the past week of battling Misty's Gym members, Amy has shown herself to be a competent trainer with a good sense of humor and showmanship. She would fit right in at Cerulean, if she decides to stay.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean Misty's going to make getting her badge easy for the girl. "Thrice the speed it is! Referees, prepare the buzzers! If either of us spends more than half a second without a pokemon out, the match will be forfeit. Ready? Set! Go, Nomo!"</p>

<p>Her quagsire appears on a sand island between their two raised platforms. Water divides them from the stands, beyond which are the open ocean to the north and Cerulean City to the south. Her gym was built just off the beach of Cerulean Bay, with various stadiums constructed at natural points along the coast. Their audience sits in raised bleachers of easily transported plastic and aluminum, and the arena has no roof, opening their battle to the sky.</p>

<p>Amy withdraws her raichu as Nomo sends a Mud Slap at it, and replaces it with an ivysaur who sends Razor Leaves back at the tentacruel Misty replaces her quagsire with. The Gym Leader's hands never stop moving, withdraw and summon and switch and withdraw and summon and switch, as she and her challenger shout commands.</p>

<p>"Osu, Ice Beam!"</p>

<p>"Modius, Psyshock!"</p>

<p>"Ruby, Night Slash!"</p>

<p>"Pepen, Sludge Bomb!"</p>

<p>"Nomo, Mud Slap!"</p>

<p>"Tetra, Razor Leaf!"</p>

<p>"Osu, Ice Beam!"</p>

<p>Tentacruel against hypno against crawdaunt against skuntank against quagsire against ivysaur until Misty's back to her tentacruel, who narrowly misses the Challenger's ivysaur with her beam as Amy replaces it with her hypno again. Their pokemon are slowly worn down from the constant attacking and switching into hits that were aimed at others.</p>

<p>Misty already took down Amy's butterfree and tangela, but crawdaunt, tentacruel and quagsire are Misty's last three pokemon, while Amy still has the raichu she used to knock out Misty's wartortle. If Misty loses her quagsire Nomo, she'll have no check against the Electric Type. But being Water/Ground means Amy's ivysaur would massacre it if she keeps it in play. Misty needs to take out the ivysaur to have a chance.</p>

<p>"Pepen, Sludge Bomb!"</p>

<p>"Nomo, Mud Slap!"</p>

<p>Tentacruel into ivysaur, crawdaunt into hypno, quagsire into skuntank, ivysaur, tentacruel, hypno, crawdaunt, skuntank, quagsire, ivysaur, tentacruel, hypno, crawdaunt, skuntank, quagsire… throw, catch, swap, throw, catch, swap, never more than half a second between one getting withdrawn and the next coming out, setting the pattern, establishing expectation, then-</p>

<p>"Pepen, Sludge Bomb!"</p>

<p>Misty swaps Nomo in to tank the poisonous sludge again, but when Amy moves to withdraw her pokemon in anticipation of the next attack, Misty waits for the ball to leave her hand and immediately withdraws her quagsire and sends her tentacruel out instead.</p>

<p>Amy has less than half a second to decide to either summon her ivysaur into the trap or refuse to voice the command and forfeit. In truth no time to make a new decision at all, only to continue hers or let indecision decide.</p>

<p>"Go, Tetra!"</p>

<p>The ivysaur materializes, and its ball rockets back toward its owner. As Misty speaks her next command, half the eyes in the stadium follow it. One of the camera crew (probably Kara, whose reaction speed is superb) actually tracks it on a big monitor as everyone waits to see if Amy can return her pokemon fast enough.</p>

<p>"Osu, Ice Beam!"</p>

<p>"Tetra, return!"</p>

<p>The stadium erupts as the wavering white-blue light hits the ivysaur and immediately covers its skin and plants in frost before its pokeball's red beam connects to withdraw it. The rapid battle resumes with barely a missed beat, but now Misty's just waiting for the ivysaur to come back out, weakened and ready to be picked off.</p>

<p>"Go, Modius, Psyshock!"</p>

<p>"Ruby, Night Slash!"</p>

<p>"Pepen, Sludge Bomb!"</p>

<p>"Nomo, Mud Slap!"</p>

<p>The ivysaur returns and is hit by the earthy projectile, but this time it's too hurt to shrug it off and stumbles, patches of frost making its movements stiff.</p>

<p>"Tetra, Mega Drain!"</p>

<p><em>Oh no you don't. "</em>Go, Osu!"</p>

<p>Her tentacruel materializes just as in time for the ivysaur to begin sapping its life… and instead the plant pokemon staggers away, veins filled with a poison even its own can't combat.</p>

<p>"Tetra, return!"</p>

<p>Three to three now, but the battle is decided. Misty plays conservatively, scoring free hits every time Amy is forced to swap in her raichu by using Nomo to negate its attacks. Little by little Misty's pokemon catch up in the war of attrition... until Amy takes her own gamble.</p>

<p>"Luxi, Slam!"</p>

<p>The raichu dashes forward and throws its weight into Nomo, who's already nearing the end of his endurance.</p>

<p>"Nomo, Mud Slap!"</p>

<p>"Luxi, Quick Attack!"</p>

<p>The pokemon duke it out for a few tense seconds, and then Nomo falls and doesn't get back up.</p>

<p>"Nomo, return! Go, Osu!"</p>

<p>"Luxi, Thunderbolt!</p>

<p>"Osu, Acid!"</p>

<p>Electricity crackles, sending her tentacruel's many limbs flailing until it lies still, but the raichu squeals in pain as it rolls in the dirt. Amy quickly withdraws it, and sends her skuntank out against Misty's newly summoned crawdaunt.</p>

<p>"Poison Jab!"</p>

<p>"Crab Hammer!"</p>

<p>"Sludge Bomb!"</p>

<p>"Bubblebeam!"</p>

<p>Down goes the skuntank, and now the stadium is deathly quiet as Amy sends her Psychic pokemon out against Misty's Water/Dark.</p>

<p>"Ruby, Night Slash!" Her pokemon rushes forward to deliver the final blow, safe in its immunity and trusting its thick shell to take any physical attacks the hypno tries-</p>

<p>"Modius, Focus Blast!"</p>

<p>The stadium explodes with noise and Misty stares in shock as the psychic pokemon drops its pendulum, cups its palms toward the onrushing crawdaunt… and with a sudden tensing of its body, causes her pokemon to collapse.</p>

<p>Trained psychic though she is, Misty couldn't make out the attack. She knows others who claim the move looks like a blinding sphere of blue light, a bullet of <em>ki </em>that blows its opponent's "energy" all out of balance, but to her it was just a gesture.</p>

<p>Regardless, the results are clear, and Misty quickly withdraws her pokemon. "Congratulations, Challenger!" she says, voice drowning out the crowd over the speakers. "An absolutely masterful surprise attack, kept hidden until the perfect moment! Cerulean Gym hereby recognizes you, Amy Brennan, with the Cascade Badge, for demonstrating adaptability and quick thinking to surprising circumstances. Your journey will place you in many environments, present you with many choices. May what you've learned at our gym and our city keep you safe from life's unexpected tides."</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />

<p>Misty hops off Nessa as the lapras brings her to the shore at the bottom of the cliffs, then pats her pokemon's long blue neck and withdraws her. She's on one of the few patches of sand sloping up to form a beach, and waves crash against the rocks to either side as she walks up the dunes and makes her way to the southern side of the cliffs above her.</p>

<p>After meeting with Amy for some private congratulations and a membership offer to her gym, Misty got a message from her Second asking her to come to the cliffs northwest of Cerulean City. Ariya reported that she found a new cave that wasn't on any maps, and Misty asked her Second to wait so she could take a quick rest and join her in investigating.</p>

<p>The climb from the beach to the cliffs is rough, but the view from the top is worth it. Mount Moon rises up to the west and Cerulean City stretches out to the southeast. She can just see Nugget Bridge to the east, but the curving path around the cliff quickly obscures it. The wind carries the salt of the ocean up to her as it crashes against the cliffs below.</p>

<p>The walk is a bit longer than Ariya suggested, but the refreshing breeze and gorgeous scenery holds Misty over until the path takes a sharp curve around the cliff face and trails down to a small plateau. Ariya is there with her feraligatr Renekton out, both facing a massive, uneven hole in the rocks.</p>

<p>Misty's Gym doesn't have a formal dress code, but if anyone could convince her to institute one, it would be her Second. Today Ariya is dressed in black fishnet leggings, a side slit mini-skirt, and a tank top that bares her midriff. It's not the immodesty that bothers Misty, who regularly wears swimsuits to challenge matches and some public appearances, but the lack of protective clothing in the field, and the influence it might have on the younger, more impressionable trainers more interested in looking cool than protecting themselves. At least Ariya's boots are always serviceable.</p>

<p>"Big," Misty says upon reaching them.</p>

<p>"Told you. I'm thinking a rhydon, tried to bust through and caused the rest to collapse. Problem is, no rubble."</p>

<p>Misty walks over to the cliff and looks down. "Rocks must have been blown clear, fell into the sea. No blast marks either?"</p>

<p>"Nope. This is how I found it."</p>

<p>"Have Dorin check for any reports of people hearing explosions anyway."</p>

<p>Ariya nods and sends a quick text before tucking her phone back away. "Would have to be in the past few days. The last satellite mapped this area a week ago. No hole."</p>

<p>"Convenient. Ready?"</p>

<p>"After you, fearless Leader."</p>

<p>Misty sprays herself with a can of repel, then summons Celest and mentally orders the starmie to lift itself into the air as they enter the cavern. With another mental command the red jewel at her center blazes bright and gives Misty and Ariya their first look inside.</p>

<p>The hole was punched through the wall of a wide cavern stretching off to their right and left. The ground slopes down straight ahead into water, with stalactites and stalagmites giving it the appearance of a hungry mouth.</p>

<p>"Cheerful," Ariya says. "I'll take the left path."</p>

<p>"No, we're sticking together. This is a solutional cave." Misty walks over to the wall and runs her fingers over it. "Limestone. Acids in the water dissolve it and cause it to drip over time, which forms the stalas."</p>

<p>"Right, I knew that."</p>

<p>Misty smiles. "Point is, it's not some new tunnel dug by pokemon. It took centuries to form. I think we're in a natural habitat."</p>

<p>"Ahh, shit. Think there are other exits?"</p>

<p>"If there were before I think we would have found out by now. Better check though. Right first."</p>

<p>They make their way through the cave slowly, stepping around the rough protrusions in the ground as their pokemon take up the front and rear. Renekton is surprisingly light-footed, scales making the lightest of rasps against the ground as he steps with a lazy reptilian grace. Misty keeps an empty pokeball in one hand. She splits her attention between her footing and using Celest's massively stronger psychic senses to look out for threats. Pokemon flicker by in her peripheral awareness, most underneath them in the water, some others above them through the ceiling, where more tunnels apparently extend upward.</p>

<p>The tunnel twists and turns and splits multiple times, giving them glimpses of wider caverns full of water and small islands of rock, boulder filled trenches, and whole chambers filled with veins of gleaming ore. Misty keeps them moving, turning aside from any sense of pokemon in the distance and taking only the right sides at forks.</p>

<p>Before long however they sense pokemon directly ahead, and without another path to turn to. A nest of golbat and zubat roost above. Most are asleep, but some are merely dozing, curious about the sounds the Leader and her Second make, loud as shouts to their sensitive ears. The repel confuses their sense of smell, but there's no disguising the warm blood beneath their skin. Though Celest has no way to interpret the sensory input she's receiving, Misty can almost feel the saliva pool in the golbat's elastic mouths, and it takes a moment for her to realize she can hear it falling in a steady patter up ahead.</p>

<p>She holds a hand up to pause Ariya, heart pounding. If it wasn't for Renekton's looming, dangerous presence, the roost might have attacked by now. Misty and Celest make their way back, past Ariya and Renekton, and begin leading them back to the entrance. After five minutes Ariya whispers, "What was it?"</p>

<p>"Golbat, a lot of them. This place is definitely a habitat, and not a new one."</p>

<p>They take the path back to the entrance, then try the left hand path for another half hour. When the ground splits, half sloping up and the other sloping down into a pool of water, they stop and follow the twists and turns of the cavern back toward the entrance. As they do Celest picks up a mass of minds from aquatic pokemon below them, goldeen or magikarp. The school of fish is a wash of brief, indistinct thoughts, pinpricks of light that swim in shifting clouds… and then suddenly break apart in panic as something massive charges through the water, full of hunger and rage.</p>

<p>"Hey, you okay? Misty?"</p>

<p>Ariya's hand is on Misty's shoulder, and she realizes she and Celest have frozen. "Yeah. There's a gyarados right under us."</p>

<p>Her Second's eyes are wide in the crimson light. "Let's get the hell out of here."</p>

<p>They move quickly after that, trusting the safety of the backtracked path and Celest's sensory field to alert them of danger. An odd triplet of minds suddenly approaches from one of the side tunnels, and Misty picks up the pace, moving them past its tunnel just as it enters theirs and begins to follow them.</p>

<p>"Magneton behind us," Misty says.</p>

<p>"Are you shitting me? Here?" Ariya snaps her fingers in a quick pattern, and Renekton sidles up closer to them. "Should we take it down?"</p>

<p>"Not worth the risk of attracting others. We're almost out." Misty can feel her pokemon tiring from keeping itself levitated for so long, and is happy to see the gleam of sunlight in the distance.</p>

<p>Until the sunlight gets obscured by a humanoid figure emitting a powerful psychic field.</p>

<p>"Focus or split?" Ariya mutters.</p>

<p>"Split," Misty says, and immediately orders Celest to construct a Light Screen as the alakazam's mental field meets theirs. It uses brief, sharp jabs of psychic power to probe for weaknesses, and Misty keeps Celest on the defensive as Ariya turns to face the oncoming magneton, prompting Renekton to do the same.</p>

<p>It enters Celest's ruby light before its prongs begin to glow with electric charge, Ariya snaps three fingers. Renekton roars as his muscles flex and swell. <em>Superpower. </em>An ability that would allow Renekton to deliver a devastating physical blow, which would hopefully take the magneton down in one hit since it would leave Renekton weaker afterward.</p>

<p>A bolt of electricity fills the cavern with light and the smell of ozone. Renekton roars in pain this time, but when Misty blinks the after-image out of her eyes she sees him still standing, partially protected by Celest's Light Screen. Renekton charges forward on all fours to attack the magneton, and Misty turns her attention to the alakazam.</p>

<p>She doesn't waste time trying to beat the devastatingly powerful psychic at its own game, and commands Celest to attack with a Bubblebeam. The tight stream of water jets out at the alakazam, only to crash against its own defenses.</p>

<p>The alakazam has the measure of Celest now, and presses the attack. Celest can hold her own defensively, but alakazam are weak to physical attacks, and that's not starmie's forte. Misty considers summoning a second pokemon, but her concentration is already nearing its limit. Another bolt of electricity lights the cavern behind her, but she doesn't turn, trusting Celest's Light Screen to help keep Renekton safe as crashing fills the cavern and the feraligatr roars again.</p>

<p><em>We need to end this now, before more pokemon show up. </em>What she needs is a more powerful water attack. Starmie don't hold much inside themselves, but there's another source nearby.</p>

<p>"Ariya?"</p>

<p>"This fucker is quick, still haven't hit it!"</p>

<p>"Screen is fading, do I need to refresh it or can you hold out for a second?"</p>

<p>"I'll bait another one, then you can let it go." There's some snapping, and then, "Now!"</p>

<p>Another flash of electricity, and Misty lets the screen fade as she fully merges her mind with Celest's. She can't quite make her pokemon understand her, can't quite imbue it with her intelligence or interpret its instinctual use of its abilities… but she's spent years guiding Celest and understanding how to influence the starmie's natural inclinations.</p>

<p>"Going dark!"</p>

<p>Celest zips around the corner and into the pool of water, taking the light with her. The starmie begins to spin and suck in as much water as she can. As she bloats in size, she lifts herself and the water around her, launching out of the pool to crash over the alakazam in a crushing wave.</p>

<p>Misty rushes forward and locks a greatball onto the dazed psychic. It recovers enough to send a telekinetic blast at the exhausted Celest, pinning her to a stalactite before Misty throws her ball and captures it.</p>

<p>The pain in Misty's chest brings her to her knees, and she forces herself to concentrate as the crimson light around them begins to blink with Celest's fading life. Her pokemon is in pain and exhausted, and Misty can't mentally get her to free and heal herself. The ceiling isn't high though, and Misty summons her blastoise and orders him to stay still on all fours.</p>

<p>Misty quickly climbs onto his back and uncouples their minds before yanking her pokemon off the impaling stalactite, anticipating another blast of electricity and rushing to get the Light Screen back up before it comes. Instead she hears a <em>thud </em>and a <em>crack </em>as she unclips a Full Restore from her belt and sprays it over her pokemon.</p>

<p>Renekton roars in victory over his fallen foe, and Misty smiles as Celest's gem regains its full, bright glow. She strokes its spongy limbs and sends it mental thoughts of comfort and pride.</p>

<p>There's a flash as Ariya captures the magneton, and Misty slides off her blastoise's shell to withdraw him before collecting the alakazam's ball. She goes to see if there's anything she can do to help with Renekton, but Ariya is already spraying him with medicine.</p>

<p>"Nicely done, both of you."</p>

<p>"Nothing to it. This big lug could use a few more shocks, maybe they'll speed him up." She rubs Renekton's toothy snout, and the feraligatr growls in pleasure.</p>

<p>They leave the cave, relaxing once they're back outside. Misty withdraws Celest and waits for her nerves to calm as she thinks, eyes closed and face turned toward the sun. "This place is going to need a quarantine," she says.</p>

<p>"Yeah, no shit. Those pokemon were tough as any wilds I've seen."</p>

<p>Fully wild habitats are rare in regions these days. Even the Safari goes through occasional cullings. "And it's been here beside the city all this time. We're lucky there hasn't been an outbreak sooner."</p>

<p>"How long do you think it would take to clean it out a bit?"</p>

<p>"Months. Or we could just try to close it up again, but in the meantime no one goes in, no matter how many badges they have."</p>

<p>"You want the Rangers on it, or our people?"</p>

<p>Misty hesitates. "If there are other entrances, we'll need the Rangers."</p>

<p>"With pokemon that powerful in there? You said it yourself, if there were, I think we'd have found out about it by now. And hey, think of how much stronger we'll get with access to monsters like those. I never knew I wanted a magneton, but I'm sure I'll find some uses for it."</p>

<p>Ariya's right, but Misty doesn't want to make the decision for selfish reasons. Then again, if the Rangers show up then word's going to get out. People will try to get in, make their own entrance if need be. Better to keep it quiet for now...</p>

<p>"Set up a rotation, only people you know can handle it." Misty's phone chirps at her, no doubt updating with messages she was sent while in the cavern sans signal.</p>

<p>"Yes'm. Shouldn't be a lack of interest, once they know what they have the chance to catch. What should we do if someone else comes by?"</p>

<p>Misty takes her phone out to check her messages. "Unless an Elite or Champion shows up, just let them know it's off limits, League business." She blinks at the screen, then curses.</p>

<p>Ariya raises her brow. "What's up?"</p>

<p>Misty summons her abra and mentally registers their location, then focuses her mind on her gym's rooftop. "I've got to get back to Cerulean. Something happened on Mt. Moon."</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />

<p>Misty enters the press room at a brisk pace, back and gaze straight. There aren't many reporters in attendance, but she still sees a face she hoped not to. Zoey is a good journalist, or at least that's what people tell her, but as Gym Leader Misty just finds the woman a pain in the ass. Her only consolation is that Mayor Tonio would be at the mic a lot longer than her, whenever he arrives.</p>

<p>The cameras are already filming when she mounts the steps to the podium. As she waits for the room to quiet down, she pulls a notecard from her sleeve and places it by the microphone, where the raised edges hide it from view. She can feel the general wash of emotions from everyone, a faint breeze of anticipation and anxiety against her mind. There's also a sense of hunger that she's come to recognize, mostly from journalists and Challengers: ambition.</p>

<p>"Hello, and thank you for coming," she says when the room is silent. "An hour ago I learned that a Tier 1 Emergency was taking place on Mt. Moon. A paras colony began a mass migration that spilled out onto the mountain when pokemon within it broke through the surface as they fled. Unfortunately, the location they emerged was a paleontological dig site on the southern mountain face, which had 37 staff members and 16 security on site at the time of the incident.</p>

<p>"Thanks to the efforts of the scientists and security team, and the immediate response of nearby trainers and Rangers, the threat was contained, pushed back, and eradicated before it could spread and necessitate a full scale response like that of the Viridian Forest fire. It was a monumental feat of bravery and skill, and all of Cerulean thanks them."</p>

<p>She can see the reporters readying to ask questions, and heads them off. "Unfortunately, there were a number of casualties. It is with great sorrow that I report the loss of Kazuo Soto, Fareed Newell, Irina Fujita, Dawson Haulover, Agustin Santiago, Mary Ashcroft, and Cerulean's own Tetsu Akita. Today we honor their memories, and their sacrifice, without which many more lives would surely have been lost.</p>

<p>"There is one more piece of news. Rangers and on site security have confirmed a Renegade branding in the aftermath. The geologist apparently took advantage of the crisis to try and steal the dig's fossils, nearly killing two of the site's defenders in the process."</p>

<p>Cold silence dominates the room as everyone tries to process such an evil act. Misty allows it to linger, her own revulsion lending new steel to her voice and gaze.</p>

<p>"I want to assure everyone in this city that I will be leaving for Mt. Moon shortly so that I can learn of his crimes, ensure they were appropriately Witnessed, and then oversee his execution personally."</p>

<p>The crowd is quiet for a moment longer, and when it's clear that she wouldn't say anything more, begin shouting questions. Misty glances at the door, which she's hoping the mayor will walk through at any moment. Damn the man, he had more time to prepare than she did.</p>

<p>"One question at a time, please. I'll be leaving for the mountain soon, but will answer as many as I can. Yes, Mia?" she asks, picking a reporter at random.</p>

<p>"When will the name of the Renegade be made public?"</p>

<p>"The Rangers will release it when they see fit, as usual. They haven't even told me. Jordan?"</p>

<p>"Will you be calling for an evacuation of the mountain?"</p>

<p>"Right now the Rangers have already placed Mt. Moon on high alert, and every trainer, merchant and Center staff should be aware of the event. The Rangers have increased their patrols of the mountain to search for any hints of an ongoing threat, but so far have reported none. Tyrisha?"</p>

<p>"Are you mobilizing the gym, Leader?"</p>

<p>"Every member is on standby in case the Rangers call for help. Alan?"</p>

<p>"What aid are we sending to the dig site?"</p>

<p>"That's a question for Mayor Tonio, who should be here soon." <em>I'm going to strangle him. </em>She's running out of opportunities not to call on Zoey, who sits patiently with her hand raised. <em>Better get it over with. </em>Zoey's known to ask tough questions, and if Misty ends up having to call on her and does so last it would signal reluctance. "Yes, Zoey?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Leader. The initial alert went out almost three hours ago, now. Why did it take so long for our city to respond?"</p>

<p><em>Dammit. </em>She doesn't want to so much as hint at the existence of the cavern. "Unfortunately I was investigating a report of wild pokemon outside the city during the initial alert, and had no cell reception." Her heart sinks as she realizes that would almost certainly invite more questions. <em>I should have prepared an excuse for this.</em></p>

<p>"Why didn't your Second mobilize the Gym?"</p>

<p>"One question each, please. Frank?"</p>

<p>"Same question, Leader."</p>

<p>"Ariya was with me. Peter held the Gym, and reported that he began mobilization at a medium priority. Due to the distance he knew only psychics with a teleporter and trainers with fliers would arrive on time to help, and two members of the Gym did leave for the mountain before the crisis was passed. Yes, Paula?"</p>

<p>"Where were you and Ariya investigating? Was there another incident today?"</p>

<p>"No, thankfully we were able to address the issue." Misty is grateful that Paula asked two questions so she could ignore the first. Zoey has her hand up again, but luckily so do others. "Sachio?"</p>

<p>"Was anyone injured?"</p>

<p>"No. Mia?"</p>

<p>"What prompted the investigation?"</p>

<p>"A routine patrol brought up a concern." She's dodging, and knows it shows. For a Leader and their Second to personally investigate something would make it anything but a "routine" concern.</p>

<p>Zoey's hand is still in the air, ready to ask where it took place that didn't have reception, and at that point Misty's choices will be to either look like she's making excuses, which makes her weak and potentially suspicious, or to give away details that could expose the cave.</p>

<p><em>No win, don't play.</em> "I'm sorry, but that's all the time I have<em>—</em>"</p>

<p>The door opens and the mayor walks in. "<em>—</em>so please direct any remaining questions to Mayor Tonio." <em>Asshole. </em>A few seconds earlier and she wouldn't have had to appear like she was running, but at least he arrived in time for a clean transition.</p>

<p>She slips the card in her sleeve and hands the podium over to the Mayor with a quick smile and nod, then turns on her heel and strides out of the room. "Dial Ariya," she says after putting her earpiece in. "Report?"</p>

<p>"I've got Molly and Ryuso here, they've been briefed. What's up on the mountain?"</p>

<p>"You'll figure it out as soon as you check the news. I'll fill you in later with the rest, just head back to the Gym and take over for Peter."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>Misty ends the call as she exits the building and summons Nimbus. "Hey boy, ready for a ride?" She straps the swanna's harness on, then lifts herself up and dons her goggles just as the door behind her opens and Zoey walks out, clearly looking for her and just as clearly surprised to see her already leaving. Misty gives an apologetic smile and wave, then takes off toward the distant mountains before the reporter can open her mouth.</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />

<p>The sun is beginning to set as Misty and Nimbus reach Mount Moon and start to climb altitude. The air turns chilly with the fading light and lower pressure, and Misty buttons her coat as a shiver wracks her form.</p>

<p>The dig site is easy to spot from the air, and she hunches down and banks toward it. When they get closer she can see the aftermath of the battle still being cleaned up, and feels a pang of guilt for having missed it. She might not have made it on time even if she hadn't been in the cavern, but this could clearly have been much worse.</p>

<p>She begins a slow, circling descent until she can land in front of the dig's largest building. She takes a moment after dismounting to let her legs get used to standing and walking again, then knocks on the door and enters.</p>

<p>The inside is spacious, with a long table and chairs taking up half of the room and the rest left open with counters and cabinets. The building clearly serves as a meeting hall for staff, and Misty spies the site director Dr. Zapata, some of her people, and a ranger at one end of the room while Leader Giovanni and Leader Brock hold their own council at the other. She takes her gloves off and slips them in her coat pockets as she walks to her peers.</p>

<p>"Ah, Misty. Thank you for coming," Giovanni says.</p>

<p>"Hello Giovanni, Brock. It's good to see you two again."</p>

<p>Giovanni inclines his head. "I only wish the circumstances were better."</p>

<p>"Me too. I'm sorry I'm late."</p>

<p>"It's no trouble, we've only just been ready to begin. Let's speak again after." Giovanni heads toward the table, and the dig site staff take the cue and do the same. Dr. Zapata takes the head seat at one end, and her people sit around her.</p>

<p>"Glad you could make it," Brock murmurs to Misty as they follow Giovanni.</p>

<p>She smiles. "You know I wouldn't leave you alone with him if I could avoid it."</p>

<p>He grins back. When Leaders meet there are almost always important decisions made about their shared territory, and any not present for those discussions tend to lose out. On top of that, though neither would admit it, on their own it's easy to be intimidated by the Viridian Leader, and go along with whatever he says. When they're together though, it's not as hard to challenge or push back against him from time to time. If Giovanni ever resented the younger Leaders that shared his borders banding against him, he never showed it.</p>

<p>When Misty first became a Leader she felt like something of a fraud around the others. It wasn't so bad with younger ones like Brock, or later Erika when she took over Celadon, but Koga, Blaine, Surge, and even Sabrina were all so serious and intimidating. And then there was Giovanni, for whom becoming Champion was just a footnote in his legend. Now, after leading Cerulean for almost five years, she feels much more comfortable in her position, but is still occasionally humbled by the fact that they share the same title.</p>

<p>Leader Giovanni takes the other head seat, and Brock goes to the one on his left while she sits at the old champion's right. She wondered if Erika would come, as she's the fourth Leader to share borders with them, but technically the mountain range doesn't extend to Celadon, so she must have bowed out.</p>

<p>"First, my gratitude to you for joining us, Leaders," Dr. Zapata says. "We've all had a harrowing day, as you can imagine, and we appreciate your presence on such short notice."</p>

<p>"Of course," Giovanni says. "My sincerest condolences for your losses, and my thanks for your bravery and sacrifices." Brock and Misty murmur their agreement, and Dr. Zapata bows her head.</p>

<p>"Thank you. As soon as we've finished cleaning the site, I've announced a week of mourning and rest before work resumes. I hope by then to have a new security plan in place to assure our financiers and ensure another incident like this isn't repeated, or is better defended against."</p>

<p>The others with her nod their agreement, all but one, who sits in distracted silence. Misty recognizes him, the ACE trainer in charge of security for the site. Pete? Palmer? Something like that. She doesn't need her powers to tell he's not happy about the topic of conversation. Anxiety, pride, and shame radiate off him in a tightly controlled spiral that fluctuates with his breaths.</p>

<p>"Understandable. First, let us review the facts," Giovanni says. "The parasect colony was migrating through the mountain, resulting in a wave of fleeing pokemon. One of the forefronts of that wave broke through the weakened ceiling under one of the dig sites. Tragically, two personnel were immediately killed then. I think we can all agree, this is where our review must begin."</p>

<p>Brock leans forward. "Your seismographs. Why didn't they give warning of the attack?"</p>

<p>One of the site employees speaks up. "They did, but the person tasked with monitoring them claims that he was not with them at the time. He was later branded a Renegade for using the attack as an excuse to try and steal the fossils, but in any case, it was an unforeseeable failure in site security."</p>

<p>"Unforeseeable," Brock says, and looks around. "Does anyone disagree?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be better to ask what you plan to do different, moving forward," Giovanni says.</p>

<p>"Two people assigned to monitor it, and one must be present at all times, of course," Dr. Zapata says. "We've already begun such a system."</p>

<p>"Allow me to make a suggestion, then. Update your equipment and send its output over local wireless. Install apps to allow remote monitoring at all times, with alerts for signals over a threshold."</p>

<p>Dr. Zapata looks surprised. "Does equipment and software exist for such small vibrations? We're hoping to detect things far more subtle than even the lightest earthquakes."</p>

<p>Giovanni makes a careless gesture with one hand. "I believe one of my people has spoken of something similar. I will check and ensure you have access to it later tonight. If not, I will try and finance its creation. It would no doubt be a widely useful technology in any case."</p>

<p>"That... would be very helpful, Leader. Thank you."</p>

<p>"Next, then. The response to the incident was immediate and effective: removal of the hazardous spores. Unfortunately another person was killed by the moving cloud. What happened?"</p>

<p>A woman speaks up next. "I was the one that made the call, Leader. We had moments to recognize the threat and act before it could spread further and make any coordinated response impossible. I recognized the risk and gave warning of our intentions, then cleared the spores when we received only affirmative messages of safety. Mary… wasn't one of those to respond, either to say she was clear or not. It's hard to tell from the—her—remains, but I assumed that anyone unable to respond would already be hurt too badly to be saved by waiting any longer."</p>

<p>"Understandable. Does anyone here disagree with that decision or its reasoning?" No one answered, and Giovanni nodded. "We shall say no more about it then. Next..."</p>

<p>The conversation goes on, examining each point of the attack, their response, and the result. Though ostensibly the meeting is to ensure the future safety and well-being of the site employees and improve their security, Misty can feel the tension and occasional fear of those on the other side of the table. She understands. Even though they're here to help and not cast blame, it never feels good to have your decisions and actions scrutinized by others, especially those in authority, and especially decisions made in a crisis.</p>

<p>At one point Misty senses a spike of anger and indecision from one of the dig employees, an older man with his arms crossed. She waits for the current speaker to finish before saying, "If I could take a moment, I'd like to say that so far it sounds like everyone here did an admirable job responding to the threat. I want to thank you again for your efforts, and reiterate that this meeting is to help improve preparations in case something similar happens again." She locks her gaze on that of the older man. "Don't be afraid to say something if you have a suggestion or comment. You're among friends."</p>

<p>He drops his eyes when she finishes speaking, and after the other members of the table murmur their agreement and thanks, looks up again. "I…" He hesitates. "I had a thought. Earlier. Didn't want to accuse anyone of anything. Still don't. You're right, everyone did a fine job. Seen a lot of Tier 1s over the years. This was kept local, very local. A fine job."</p>

<p>He frowns, and seems to be searching for words. The table waits. Finally he says, "Hell, I'll just spit it out. Some of the trainers, they were using balls to capture pokemon as they fought. Sometimes it's understandable, 'course it is, you have a moment to catch something you take it. Sometimes it's even the best choice strategically. But a lot of trainers were wasting time and energy weakening pokemon rather than killing 'em. Using status effects and baiting attacks on a particularly strong or rare pokemon, while a dozen more walk by, a threat to those around them.</p>

<p>"Like I said, I don't want to get no one in trouble, or accuse anyone. But I just thought I'd say it, make sure it was out there. Maybe we could tell the Rangers, put up a PSA to remind people. I dunno. Just thought I'd say." He's quiet a moment, then nods to himself.</p>

<p>Giovanni steeples his fingers. "Thank you, Misty, and you, Albert, wasn't it? A good point. As you said, it's an understandable impulse, but one that bears vigilance against. I'll personally speak with the mountain's Director, and see about some coverage for it in an upcoming issue of The Daily Trainer."</p>

<p>The conversation only goes on another few minutes, and as it wraps up Misty prepares to address the issue she's concerned about. Giovanni glances at her and lifts a finger from the table, almost imperceptible. He knows what she'll ask, and apparently wants to address something first. She nods.</p>

<p>"As we conclude, I would like to make one final suggestion," he says. "When we began this venture, the question of security was broached and, for the time, properly addressed. I want to thank you, Paul, and the rest of your people, for their good work."</p>

<p>The table murmurs agreement, and the ACE Trainer looks at Giovanni in some surprise, and to Misty's senses, trepidation. "Thank you, Leader."</p>

<p>"However. In light of this incident, I'd like to, once again, formally offer Gym services to assist in the security of the site."</p>

<p>The table is quiet. Paul's face reddens, but he doesn't speak. Giovanni's hands move apart and together, tapping his fingertips. "Let me be clear. I in no way blame Paul or his organization for anything that occurred today. But as you may remember, I offered the extra personnel initially, and was voted down by my peers and some of you sitting here. At the time I was eventually convinced that showing such favoritism for a project like this could set an undesired precedent. Now, however, I believe that this incident would clear up any potential misunderstandings by the public, and allow us to ensure the continued safety of the site employees and its assets. I understand that many fossils were almost stolen, and would have been if not for the timely intervention of some assisting trainers. That risk must be minimized as thoroughly as possible."</p>

<p>Misty and Brock exchange glances. She can read the Pewter Leader's misgivings, and still shares them herself. "I'm sure that Paul and his people will be extra diligent in watching the fossils," Misty says slowly. "And I don't know whether I can commit anyone to such a task." She thinks of the staff she'll already be committing to watching the new cavern.</p>

<p>"Nor I," Brock says. "We're still assisting in the aftermath of the Viridian Forest fire."</p>

<p>"I understand," Giovanni says. "My gym is prepared to staff it ourselves. And I have no doubt as to the efficacy of ACE training. Your people will continue to be employed, Paul, and I will be adding a bonus to their salaries. I was planning to do so regardless. To ensure there is no reduction in perimeter vigilance, however, my people can commit exclusively to guarding the fossils, and allow yours to do their jobs unhindered."</p>

<p>Paul's tension slowly leaks away, and while Misty still senses some mixed feelings, he eventually says, "Thank you, Leader. That's very generous of you."</p>

<p>"I hope that's agreeable to everyone?" Giovanni spreads his palms. "This endeavor can be the first of many profitable ventures on these mountains, and I merely wish to ensure it has every chance to achieve full success."</p>

<p>Those around the table begin to nod and voice their agreement, and Misty feels any further objections dying on her lips as even Dr. Zapata capitulates. She feels the wry amusement from Brock and raises her brow at him. Fight, or give in? Brock merely lifts his shoulders in a minute shrug and says, "With all that in mind, I can only agree, of course."</p>

<p>Misty sighs. "Agreed." This is often how it is with Giovanni: he can speak eloquently, head off objections, satisfy pride, and, just to add icing on the cake, throw around money wherever necessary to ease people's resistance and just in general be so gracious that disagreement becomes impossible.</p>

<p>She can even almost believe that it would be a good thing, though she knows the political consequences will come up again and again for years if similar projects come about. The amount of power it grants Viridian Gym is massive. Cerulean and Pewter can gain a share themselves, of course… if they're able to commit the resources. Which, of course, they can't.</p>

<p>"Good. Now that's done with, I believe Misty had one more topic to address?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you. I think it's time at last to speak of the Renegade." The mood of the room immediately plunges, and Misty throws up some light defenses to keep their emotions from washing over her too much. "I would like to know all the details, if you please."</p>

<p>The Ranger lifts her head. "I believe I can cover that, Leader." She explains the situation in concise terms, voice bland as she recounts the Witnessing. Misty is surprised to hear that Blue Oak was one of the trainers to be attacked by and help stop the Renegade. She wasn't aware Sam's grandson has begun his journey already.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Ranger. Is there any reason this Yuuta hasn't been seen by a psychic yet?"</p>

<p>"He was too quick to suggest it himself for me to trust the results, and given his actions I didn't think it was necessary. You are welcome to examine him if you wish, Leader. Will you be the one to oversee his execution?" She looks between Misty, Brock and Giovanni. "I assumed I would have to transfer him to one of your cities, but with all three of you here…"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can oversee it. I'll meet with him as soon as we finish here."</p>

<p>"Understood. Just find me when you're ready."</p>

<p>Giovanni looks at her, then to the rest of the table. "Does that cover everything? Any further questions? Well and good. Thank you all again, and if anyone needs to speak with me, I will be outside for a while. A good evening to the rest of you."</p>

<p>The dig staff begins speaking among themselves as they leave the table, and the three Leaders rise together and head for the door. Night has fully fallen on the mountain, and Misty stares up at the stars, so bright and rich this far from the city lights.</p>

<p>Giovanni follows her gaze. "Beautiful, aren't they? Seeing them so clearly is always a pleasant benefit to any mountain trip." He turns to her and Brock. "I hope I didn't put either of you out too much tonight?"</p>

<p>"It's your money and your people," Brock says, and Misty nods. "If you judge it to be the right thing to do, we can only bow to your wisdom."</p>

<p>"You have my thanks. Do let me know if there's anything you need help with regarding the Renegade, Misty."</p>

<p>"Same," Brock says.</p>

<p>"I think I'll be alright. I just want to make sure things go smoothly." Misty buttons her coat back up as the chill night air seeps in. Overseeing Renegade executions was an unpleasant part of being a Leader for the first year or so, but over time it became easier, especially as she began to see the results of their actions more and more. Now she just sees it as an unhappy responsibility of her office, and strives to ensure she gives each case its due consideration to ensure justice is done. "We got lucky that he was stopped. If those two trainers hadn't been passing by… but of course one of them was an Oak, so I guess it's to be expected."</p>

<p>"Indeed," Giovanni says. "None of that man's line have ever had normal journeys. Trouble seems to find them, or perhaps they simply stand out in troubling circumstances more than most."</p>

<p>"That's the truth of it," Brock says. "Blue was in the forest during the fire. I met him before speaking with you; he was widening the firebreak and helped take down a whole family of shiftry. Caught one, too, and used it to get my badge."</p>

<p>"Wait, he already beat you?" Misty says. "I didn't realize he was on his journey that long."</p>

<p>"Oh, he just began it. I think it was a month ago?"</p>

<p>Misty whistles. "That fast, yeah, I should have figured. I guess he's coming for me next? Should be fun."</p>

<p>"Don't be so sure. I'm still digging up my main arena after he revealed a strategic flaw in its design."</p>

<p>Giovanni chuckles, a rare sound. "Yes, that sounds like an Oak. After his sister, we should expect great things from him."</p>

<p>"His companions aren't without note either," Brock says. "One is seeking to become a Professor, the other some sort of journalist or politician."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard of them," Giovanni says. "If they continue to follow the young Oak on his journey, I look forward to meeting them all." Misty nods as the door behind them opens, and some of the site workers come out. "If you'll excuse me, Brock, Misty. Until next we speak." Giovanni walks off to speak with Dr. Zapata.</p>

<p>Misty sees the Ranger come out and turns to Brock. "Call you later? We've got some things to discuss."</p>

<p>"You got it. Safe travels."</p>

<p>"You too." Misty approaches Ranger Sasaki. "I'm ready."</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" />

<p>The renegade sits tied to his chair, apparently unconscious. Ranger Sasaki frowns as she finishes opening the door and sees the rest of the room. "Someone was supposed to be stationed here. You do your thing, Leader, I'm going to go speak with whoever had the last<em>—"</em> The ranger stops and stares as Misty walks up to the Renegade, heart pounding. "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>The man in front of her looks asleep, but even asleep there are flickers. Physical sensations, emotional reactions to dreams, something that she should be able to pick up this close. She puts her fingers under his nose, then presses them to his neck.</p>

<p>"Don't say it..."</p>

<p>Misty drops her hand away, mind racing. "We'd better go speak to them together, Ranger. He's already dead."</p>
