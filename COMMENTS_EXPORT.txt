Spinarak show the face on their abdomen even when using other attacks, not just as a way to do Scary Face :) Besides, I consider "mundane" moves that affect stats like Scary Face, Growl, Screech, and so on not to be actual attacks but just byproducts of those actions that might naturally occur during battle.

Congratulations on 100 chapters! I've been reading on and off for nearly 5 years now and it just keeps getting better. Your consistency and creativity are incredible. I've been struggling to find other fiction I enjoy recently, but your chapters hit the spot every time. Somehow you manage to make writing about a children's game emotionally engaging and thought-provoking in ways I never expect, and your attention to detail is immaculate. It's almost a shame that enjoyment of your work is gated behind being willing to read "Pokemon fan fiction," but I'm nonetheless proud and amazed that something this good can come from such a seemingly niche interest. Thanks again for sharing your world with us. I look forward to continuing reading for as long as you'll keep writing.P.S. happy new year!

This is all starting to come to a head, isn't it? I can't tell whether Giovanni will be alarmed by such a massive leak or pleased that it's leaked as fiction to throw people off the reality of the situation, but either way he can't be happy about the leak itself. Unless he's the one orchestrating it, which would have its own series of implications. Meanwhile, Sabrina will observe that Red, the person who has been only peripherally introduced to the problem as far as she knows, has a best friend who suddenly spills all the beans in fiction form. What conclusion will she draw from that?

I've been wondering, why do you sometimes post little anecdotes at the beginning of the chapters on the other site but not here? If anything I'd expect it to be the other way around since this site also contains your blog.

I'm not sure if it was included because of my previous comment or not, but I appreciated the explanation of the battle tower. I'd still be interested a closer examination of the motivations of the people who compete there and Blue's personal opinion of them, but I'll take what I can get. Great chapter as always :)

Do you have any sort of graphic or concept map or something to keep track of what secrets everyone knows? Like even Red alone knows so many individual world-ending or otherwise consequential secrets that I'm not totally sure which he's talking about at a given moment.Also a general character sheet would be helpful if I forget a name in the sometimes several months since it was last mentioned.If I get the time I may make one of my own, I was just curious if the ideas had occurred to you before.

----------------------------------------
I do not, but I am somewhat amused by the idea, and it would definitely be useful for readers XD I doubt I'll have time to make it anytime soon, but as a simple list, for Red at least...Red knows Bill's secret about human storage.Red used sakki to even remove a pokemon's conditioning against humans.Red can perfectly lie to psychics.Red suspects Sabrina knows of secret psychic training labs.Red also knows some of Laura's and Leaf's investigation secrets, such as that the Mt. Moon renegade was murdered before being executed.Red now also knows Blue's only "secret," from Koichi, about fear enhancing training.

Author: dreary_dugong
Date: June 02, 2022 at 07:38 PM
----------------------------------------
That's totally fair. Thanks for the list! I completely forgot about the thing with Bill even though that was the first one.Tangentially, it's interesting to think about how much of Red's list of secrets does or doesn't overlap with Giovanni's.

Man, Giovanni's gotta be scrambling right now. I'm sure Sabrina would've let him know ahead of time, but this changes a lot for him. I'm also curious how Mazda will be impacted, since Mewtwo can learn Miracle Eye in the games.The depiction of competitive batting is really accurate. I'm impressed. I liked the subtle references to abilities like levitate, magic guard, and intimidate.I don't remember is this has been addressed before, but I'm interested in how trade evolutions work. For instance, one would expect Blue to want to evolve Tops into Alakazam and the fact that he hasn't yet implies that it's either not as easy as trading back and forth or that there's good reason to keep a Kadabra for awhile.


COMMENT #4
Author: Damon Sasi
Date: August 02, 2022 at 04:48 PM
----------------------------------------
Yeah, I basically just nix them; even trying to come up with less abusable mechanics, every explanation that I can come up with is still so trivially easy to do that it makes the middle evolutions essentially meaningless. The fact that "trade evolutions" also can be found in the wild in some of the games makes it clear that the mechanic is just a meta-conceit.

Ohhh, is he planning on using Red like an inquisitor (with Miracle Eye on his Dark employees)? That sounds like it's something that Red would be super uncomfortable doing, especially if it means using a pokemon on another person. Renegade-adjacent.

There's something I'm not clear on. In Market Theory, when Red asked whether the master ball could lead to conflict between regions, Silph said he planned to make it "as widely available as possible". Essentially a MAD-like conflict prevention scheme. If by that he means he's going to sell the ball in PokeShops, won't renegades have access to it then? Why go through all this effort to prevent them from stealing it now if it's almost ready to release?


COMMENT #3

----------------------------------------
Good question! The expectation isn't actually that it'll be sold in pokeshops, at least not for a long time; the plan was to put them up for bidding, so it would be clear who has them and only those with lots of money (realistically, governments and some billionaires) would be able to afford them. Silph has very low expectation that the first few dozen would end up in a renegade's hands, and by the time one might then plenty of others will already (ideally) have caught the legendaries.

Amazing! This chapter is so loaded with future implications damn. I wonder what sort of training they'll put Red through?? It gets me wondering if this'll continue to actually getting Red on the track to Champion... The story progression had me convinced that this route might not be taken, since Red had a focus on research and like that path is being occupied by Blue for the storyline and canonically Red was just one step behind Blue, but that vould be played off differently, it's still in the cards at this point. Psychic powers are helluva multiplier. That's gotta burn for Blue though, if Red just blasts his way through the League... Esp when he let Red copy Battle Calm...I wonder if Giovanni is setting Red up to be some kind of hero what with the suspicious mention of psychics? Or was it out of malice? Idk at this point. Giovanni is wayy to complex for quick assumptions lolArcher is Archie?? Team Aqua dude? And the Renegade teams apparently went and merged? Or was that a misdirection? Does that mean N is in cahoots with these people? Probably not?? Questions questions...

I'm super excited to see all these separate storylines converge not least because it lessens the cognitive load of trying to keep it all straight in my head month to month. It has been fun though. I feel like I need to break out a conspiracy board any time I try to explain this story to someone.

The way the letter uses the plural pronouns for Red but singular pronouns for the speaker makes me think it's not from Mazda. (Edit: I reread the letter, I am a fool. Ignore that point.) Also, kidnapping or otherwise manipulating Rowan doesn't seem like something Mazda would do though I suppose they might if they're desperate. My guess is the letter is somehow from the Unown hivemind. I suppose a hivemind is kind of like a foil to Red in the sense that Red was one mind that's been broken into multiple while the Unown seem to many that have become one so I'm looking forward to that dynamic.Blaine having a shiny Charizard is super rad. I'm so excited to see Blue's battle with him based on the way he talks. I love the different personalities that each leader has in this story.Bringing up Blue struggling with people who dislike him because of conspiracy theories was a nice touch. That's gotta be really frustrating to experience.There was... a significant amount of talk about personal assistants in this one? I'm not sure entirely what to make of that. It's cool to think about at least.It's awesome that Red is enjoying digging into this mystery. I hope he gets the chance to meet Dr. Fuji or other Rocket scientists at some point.Now that you mention it, it is pretty strange that ditto can't be found underwater in any Pokemon media that I know of. I look forward to the rationalization for that one if there is one. (Apparently ditto can be underwater Pokemon in Pokemon Go)Great chapter as always. I admit I was a little disappointed that it didn't jump straight into exploring the lab but I think that was mostly a problem with my own expectations/impatience. Once I got past that, I really enjoyed this chapter for its character development and world building. I look forward to next month's!

Maybe Damon is thinking about the cost/benefits of hiring an assistant? It doesn't seem plot relevant, so it's probably a rationality tip.

Red doesn't know Daniel Kahneman? that was a shock :)by the way, in an interview in 2013 (https://www.youtube.com/wat..., Kahneman was asked whether his research makes it easier for him to overcome biases and live a more rational life. "The answer is easy. No."

Huh. I find that surprising, since I've found reading his work has had that effect on my own life a number of times. I don't think I'm smarter than Daniel Kahneman, so maybe he's just being modest or holding himself to some impossibly high standard of what it means to "overcome biases." Like I don't think it's possible to totally eliminate biases, but it's certainly possible to identify and mitigate their effects. If it weren't, no one would be capable of changing their mind about any major political issue... granted it's a rare occurrence, but it does happen!

i too notice i am confused while considering his answer, and ISTM your hypothesis is quite probable.i should note that i translated from hebrew and edited for brevity.a more accurate version would be:the interviewer asked whether Kahneman's continuous work on rational thinking and cognitive processes makes him a person that is more likely to overcome difficulties/hardships, and whose life are more rational (they did speak just before that about biases, but now i think that my interpretation of 'hardships' as 'biases' wasn't accurate. the question seems to be more general).and the rest of Kahneman's answer is "I don't think better than i used to think in the past, but it seems to me that i have improved a lot in my ability to criticize others, but not necessary myself."still, i enjoy noticing the similarity between my thoughts and Red's: "surely this great professor is much more rational now, with all of his experience and knowledge, regardless of his answer to that direct question".but maybe i shouldn't dismiss his answer? it sounds unlikely, but it could be that he is brilliant, while also not that good at thinking about his own thinking (he doesn't say that knowing more doesn't improve others' thinking). also, i probably should give his answer much more weight, just because i consider him to be that brilliant.also, one could argue that people almost always change their minds about politics because of some external reason (e.g. someone predicts that pro gay marriage views would become more and more common in the near future, and thus shifts his own view - consciously or unconsciously), and only rarely because actually realizing that some bias effected their reasoning.but that's me just nitpicking your argument. i am totally for a mandatory cognitive-bias in every school, etc.

Developing ideas has more of an effect in oneself than any conceivable application of them. Conceiving some "thing" that enables an "easier" action would need two different states (with and without) and a common graded reference (scale of easeness). His answer is understandable.Biases are figures of speech. To ease oneself in avoidance of some "thing" should be a comparisson between paths crossing same arena, not the presence or absence of obstacle-goggles.

While I haven't read a ton of Psychic Battles put into words, this one felt phenomenally unique and methodically designed. Tense, meaningful, and cleverly (ab)used the fact that psychics can Amnesia (or partition) memories to surprise both their opponent and the reader. Also, finally, the dreamer has made contact, a moment I've been eagerly awaiting for months or even years to see. It's both fulfilling to finally see, and yet a most terrible tease since it was cut off. I'm going to cross my fingers that their conversation in full arrives with the next chapter, possibly even from the other side's viewpoint.

Daystar,I’ve been reading pokemon and the origin of species for almost a decade. It feels like it’s been longer. In the classic style of a modern parasocial relationship I don’t know you, and you know me even less, but when you post a day or a week late I notice and wonder and hope you’re well.Every time you post a few days late with an apology I appreciate your tenacity. To have pushed through whatever challenges hit you upside your proverbial head that month and still pulled through only a few days late impresses me. I hope that this is a type2 fun challenge for you and adds to your life rather than doubling down the challenges during the hard times.That you've exposed me to high level thought processes through, what is on its surface, such a silly medium as a pokemon fanfic is sublime. You are quite the person.I appreciate the last 9 years I’ve had the privilege to read your work. I hope simultaneously that your story ends soon and goes for the rest of my life. I want -need- to know the resolution to this epic. But leaving these characters stories will be a loss to my monthly agenda.If I could change something about your story it would be to have reached out years ago. And for you to be able to publish and monetize this epic adventure.See you next month

What a way to start a chapter. I like how the conflict between the trio is going, to me it seems very natural and realistic, especially for preteens. And I like how Leaf is a natural conflict-mediator, like myself. She doesn’t really start fights, but she’s good at ending them. Blue has a protective vibe to me, and so I can understand him not wanting to admit vulnerabilities or seem weak, because it’s harder to be seen as a protector with holes in your shell. By contrast, Red is very much a thinker, but while he’s good at analyzing his feelings (and others, on retrospect), he seems to struggle with instinctively picking up emotions like Leaf. Like Blue, he doesn’t want to admit to weakness because of pride, but from what we’ve learnt of his character here, it’s more a defense mech. When you’re alone like he is, your confidence is the best defense, and it’s easier to be confident when you believe it yourself, so it makes sense he’s hesitant to give any reason to doubt his shield. By contrast, leaf seems secure enough in herself to admit her weaknesses to others. They’re such interesting characters, and I feel we got to know them really well this chapter. It was brilliant, thank you,(TL;DR: red is the brains, Blue is the brawns, and Leaf is the Heart)

Minor things that has me confused: In this chapter it is said that "Pokemon like klink and magnemite seem far too organized to have just popped into existence on their own." as if implying that the origin of these pokemon is not known. However, in chapter 3 we have "when manmade pokemon like magnemite and klink started showing up".So it seems to me that the writing here is questioning the previously established fact that magnemite and klink are manmade?

'“Yep.” Ryback starts to lead them back down the ridge. “Life was all microbial back then, and that’s where it all began, for us. Prokaryotes to eukaryotes, we’re all branches from the same roots. If I recall correctly, some new research was demonstrating how we can find bacterial DNA in a lot of the human genome. Amazing, isn’t it?”“It certainly is,” Leaf says as she scribbles, while Blue grunts noncommittally and Red nods, lost in thought. He’s considering the implications of all the current life forms on the planet coming from bacteria. Do new species of pokemon that get discovered still have the same markers in their genome? If not, what would that imply? The abiogenesis theory?'I feel that Red has been missing the wood for the trees. Why are humans the *only* macroscopic species that don't generally have superpowers? Either humans have a different evolutionary history from pokemon (which suggests that pokemon were created with Sufficiently Advanced Technology and replaced native lifeforms, or else that human civilisation was once capable of interstellar travel), or else humans are a kind of pokemon.It would be very odd for humans to lose superpowers in becoming sapient, partly because hominids couldn't have survived against pokemon without having something better than stone tools and tactics, partly because being psychic is a tremendous advantage for a social primate and a trainer, and partly because energy budgets don't seem to matter much to pokemon.Regarding technology, the oldest Oldowan tools are about 2.5 million years old, and tool use probably goes back significantly further than that. Homo sapiens sapiens is about 200,000 years old. But domestication of animals seems to be at most 15,000 years old, and taming of wild animals seems unlikely to be too much older than that. How would weak, sapient hominids survive long enough to tame pokemon?Regarding psychic trainers, some modern humans are capable of pokemon-like feats. In particular, some humans can read and manipulate the minds of pokemon and other humans. That's an incredible advantage for a member of a species with complex social behaviour - I'm convinced that the Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis is correct, i.e. that an intelligence arms race to win social games is the primary reason for human intelligence - and an incredible advantage for a hominid that could be killed by the local equivalent of a pigeon or a rabbit. Any similar advantage seems similarly unlikely to atrophy - for example, fighting-type humans (Aura users) seem to also have huge social and physical advantages, without any apparent loss of intelligence.Regarding energy budgets, pokemon laugh at the idea. One Flamethrower, Earthquake or Hyper Beam must involve far more energy than could reasonably be gained from food (unless, perhaps, the primary producers - ordinary non-sentient plants, phytoplankton, chemoautotrophs and so on - are also able to draw on the magical energy source that powers pokemon). Moreover, such an attack must involve at least as much energy as is used to support a human brain. That means that there should be no ATP shortage for supporting larger brains - the marginal cost of a bigger brain is much lower than IRL, so the same marginal benefit should lead to a higher-IQ equilibrium. So we should expect the smartest animals (humans) to be much smarter than real-world humans and pokemon in general to be smarter than real-world life-forms in similar ecological niches.

These are all good points! It's worth noting though that there are a number of normal pokemon that don't, to all appearances, have "powers." Like raticate or ursaring, where all their attacks are basically just physical uses of their natural weapons. There aren't really any overt signs that such pokemon have something "extra" to them that humans don't.And yeah, energy budgets are screwy in Pokemon. But since the humans don't really have a baseline for what's abnormal, things like that are just "the way reality is" to them

a couple of thoughts regarding the tangela cell and regeneration. the biggest limit regarding rapid regeneration are telomeres. every cell starts out with a finite length of telomere at the end of their chromosomes, and when it splits (read: regenerates) the remaining telomeres are shortened. when you run out the chromosomes start shortening instead. that is, generally speaking, bad. if you mess with the telomeres, you risk messing with your apoptosis, probably get some cancer and die. if you don't, you'll start spliting cells rapidly, lose your lifetime supply of telomeres in a day, get some cancer and die.the second is the usual mass conservation question. bill said the samples are losing mass. you'd expect them to gain mass instead because he's adding matter to the samples (the acid). sure, the ratio of living matter to nonliving matter should decrease over time, but that's not exactly what he said.overall i liked the chapter. i just finished binge reading the whole thing and i'm enjoying it so far, i'm looking forward to seeing where you'll take it.

Hmm, that's good to know. So for this kind of regeneration to work, the chromosomes would need very long telomere lengths would have to be massively long, right? Like starfish, but even more so?As for the mass I thought it was implied he was talking about the biomass of the tendrils, but I'll edit it to make it more clear :)Glad you're enjoying the story!

well it's been a long time since that course but iirc if you make a cell's telomere arbitrarily long (or use telomerase to constantly lengthen it) you prevent the cell from going into apoptosis, even when it really really should (for instance due to mutation), leading to cancer, death etc.

I'm not a biologist, but I think I can provide some biology technobabble that would explain the observed regenerative powers. Given how easily normal pokemon heal, I imagine that undifferentiated stem cells are standard issue, but some pokemon heal drastically more easily than others. In some cases, cancer might be avoided by outright magic; for example, Alakazam may have perfectly reliable DNA replication or may simply destroy any tumours that develop.One possible not-obviously-magical solution is to use circular chromosomes, which have a *much* simpler replication process and don't contain telomeres. I'm going to discard this possibility on the grounds that almost all eukaryotic chromosomes are linear and almost all prokaryotic chromosomes are circular, which strongly suggests that there's a good reason for complex lifeforms to have linear chromosomes. (Biology Stack Exchange has some stuff about why this might be the case, but I couldn't find a standard answer with a few minutes of searching.)The other possibility that comes to mind is having back-up DNA in specialised germ cells and a process for discarding and replacing chunks of the body. (Loss of these back-up cells, which cannot regenerate, would lead to regeneration causing either atrophy or cancer.) The somatic cells that can replicate rapidly (causing tissue regeneration) have telomeres of reasonable lengths. When an area of the body is damaged, the surviving cells (and any undifferentiated stem cells brought in from elsewhere) rapidly divide, restoring the tissue but burning through their telomeres.The cancer problem is avoided by "restoring the DNA from back-up". The specialised germ cells replicate very infrequently and have very strict proofreading and error-checking mechanisms. When part of the body is forced to regenerate, the DNA in the back-up cells only divides once, but multiple copies are made (by some unspecified process that probably involves RNA polymerase and a miracle). These copied daughter chromosomes are only slightly shorter than the mother chromosomes from the back-up germ cells.They could be used to make pluripotent stem cells that could then be transported through the body and used to grow new somatic cells at the damaged location, while the regenerated cells undergo apoptosis. Essentially, the regenerated tissue is replaced with cloned tissue that still has robust telomeres. You could also use another miracle to have some sort of virus-like cell transfer the copied DNA directly to the regenerated cells, replacing their nuclear DNA (but probably not their mitochondrial DNA) with the more trusted version. Instead of being replaced by cloned tissue, the regenerated tissue would be given new DNA with robust telomeres. (This would be harder to pull off, but would make more sense given that tissue regeneration happens so incredibly fast in some pokemon - without a mechanism like this, it would make more sense to scab and then regenerate slowly.)

Thanks for the breakdown! The idea of specialized germ cells or magic virus-like cells going around in the body ensuring that regenerated cells are error-checked and have the proper DNA is appealing, since if they're biochemically replicable enough, that could just be what potions do: massively speed up their growth, or just spray millions of new ones onto a location, whereby they acquire the DNA of their host and get to work.

I read up to this point and now I am concerned. I had no idea updates were only once a month. Lets see... we are at approximately 1.5 badges. If we assume the first 6 chapters were all intro then we are left with 32 chapters for 1.5 badges or ~21.3 chapters for each badge. Assuming that the elite 4 and the mewtwo wrapup will take about the amount of time it will take to get a badge, that is 7.5 badges still to go. 7.5 * 21.3 = 160. 160 / 12 = 13.333. So expected completion time is 13 years. Assuming that posts were made twice monthly that drops to 6.5 years. Weekly, 3.25 years. Bi-Weekly - 1.625 years.I would guess that if the story length is about what I estimate then the odds of completion are very low unless it is updated at least once a week. I base this simply on my observations of watching people update web based stories. If anyone has more complete evidence of completion rates versus time and story length I would be glad to see it.I would hate to see this story not finished. I have enjoyed what has come so far very much.

Hey there! Glad you've been enjoying the story so far. Yeah, believe me when I say that the amount of time the story will take to complete seems daunting to me as much as anyone! I can hardly believe I've been writing it for over 3 years already, though I'm very proud that I never missed an update, even given the monthly gap between chapters.I don't know if it's possible for me to push out more than a chapter a month without some significant change in my life: right now I'm working full time, and have other projects that I spend time on too. Even if I stopped all other projects, I don't think it would significantly increase my publishing pace: maybe I could publish every 3 weeks if I really pushed myself and dropped all other interests, but I think that would increase the chances of me burning out.What I can say is that the pacing of the story so far is not necessarily the pacing it will have throughout. The first badge took 27 chapters to attain: by my current plan, the next one will be done by about chapter 42, and the one after that will probably be done in another 10ish. With the majority of the world and character building out of the way, the plot will be more front-and-center for the story, and I hope that means I can finish it all in about 110-120 chapters.That still means I'll have been writing the story for 10 years, which is ridiculous to consider, but then, as a matter of wordcount, when you consider that I'm nearing 300k words after a little over 3 years, that's not all that bad compared to many published series. Even if I never get the kind of following that might allow me to write full time, I am hoping to keep going with it as long as I can, and one day finish :)

She missed a rather obvious possibility. Just because he is dark doesn't mean he does not work with psychics. A psychic was reading her thoughts during the meeting and sending them to Giovanni over the phone, which was on silent. In this way Giovanni can actually turn his dark nature into an advantage, because people will think they do not need to guard their thoughts around him.

Here a long review I expect:Over the last month I have read through all the chapters up to this one after finishing hpmor and wanting more of rational fiction. Pokemon was a rather large part of my childhood and with my current rational-esque mindset I was very glad to find this project of yours. I think you are doing a great job in writing this fanfiction. That includes the storytelling (tension and plot and so on) as well as the "consistency of the pokemon world". Before I get to, what I would be very happy to see discussed, I want thank you and congratulate you for the things I found especially pleasing:- The plot involving mewto: Your approach is excellent! I love how you see it from its perspective. It is really interesting to experience the coming into existence and initial develepmont of this new sapient creature. As far as I have understood it is very powerful but not hyperintelligent, right? - the rest of the foreshadowing of the greater plot- the admittance to how dangerous pokemon are, especially animal-like legendaries;So now to the things I am wondering about or think, are still missing:- The reason CHILDREN ARE SENT OUT ALONE WITH NEW STARTER POKEMON: I mean okay, we are facing a dangerous world, were children are forced to grow up a little earlier. But as far as it seems the cities and towns are somewhat safe and in order and provide a lifestyle comparable to the rich countries in this reality. So it is not a war situation like in some 3rd world countries, where children are kind of coerced into killing and stuff to survive. Even in the middle ages the education to a knight started after the boys had hit an age, where they were at least in puberty! So Red and the others going out with 10/11 seems quite ridiculous. Why do they actually go out right after becoming trainers? Why not train for some years, let the pokemon evolve or so. They would be safer on their journeys that way. And just think about all the education they are missing! Especially for Red it should be quite important. Ok, he is quite ahead with his knowledge but I think there should be still a lot for him to learn. The technology for pokeballs and the high medical standard do not seem trivial. Did he really learn the basics already? Wont he need it for a career in reasearch?And why the need to go alone? What is the harm of a supervisor for such a journey? I mean it is also a loss for society if the children just die after so much money is put into their education and journeing. If not for humanitarian reasons society or the governments should be interested in securing the futures of the trainer childern. Every capable trainer is valuable for the security of the whole society. I think that is all, that currently comes to mind regarding this topic.- What does it take to become a trainer? I am thinking of ethics tests actually. As you already hinted with rogues, an evil trainer might prove to be disastrous. Don't the children have to undergo some tests to be allowed to get a pokemon? - What about guns and other weapons? With such high technology as pokeballs and I think you also mentioned normal cars, why are there no weapons to fend off pokemon? Why are they never mentioned. Even simple things like arrowheada drowned in spores of plant pokemon, could keep most pokemon in check. So yeah that is actually a major flaw I think...- Why does meat seem to be so easily available? How do they manage to mass produce pidgeys or even fearows? (Bill ate Tauros steak, but i guess that is expensive.) Isn't that ridiculously dangerous? And the space required for a fearow farm would be enormous. I guess they cannot just be kept in a crammed space as the would like fight and kill each other. I would be really interested to see some mention of that :)- Now here is more of a harmless question: How do you think civilisation and urbanology works in the pokemon world. We still have only little of the world. You showed us the larger towns and cities but no villages or lone houses -except Bill's but he is special. Do they exist? I suppose, life there should be quite dangerous, unless it is a village full of capable trainers, which are not the most common thing i guess... So how do you think the cities we know from the game map came to be?As far as you have mentioned, there is also no real state or regional government (like the Kanto President or so). So how are the cities politically bonded, what makes a region a regiom? Have there ever been wars? Big questions, I know... Are we going to hear about it some time?There are even more little thoughts about this fanfiction on my mind. But let that be it for now. I want to underline that I really like your work and am really looking forward to what is coming. This is in no way meant to be negative, just curiosity and a critical mind. But I guess that is obvious for one, who writes rational fiction. So I hope my comment was helpfull as feedback. You can contact me on facebook if you would like to respond to it.Well thanks again and keep up the good work,Emil

Hey there, thanks for the review :) I'm glad you're enjoying the story so much, and am happy to address your questions!"Why are the children sent out so young and without supervision on their journeys?"This is a great question that I think has no one simple answer. The first obvious point is that I'm trying to rationalize how things work in the pokemon world without changing it too much, which means I can't just make everyone older (as some pokemon fanfiction justifiably does) or have them chaperoned by an adult, which would completely change the dynamic and feel of the "pokemon journey." To me, the goal has to be justifying their custom through the world they're in. So that means getting all the training and education they need in by the age they'd be sent out, having Ranger Outposts along every route ready to respond to distress calls in minutes, and making sure that anyone who goes out young is accompanied by traveling companions (which isn't done in the games just for gameplay reasons). Red, Leaf and Blue go out at the youngest age anyone does (11) because they're exceptionally gifted, both personally and through circumstance (mentored and equipped by Professors). Most children in the world still don't go out until they're older, like 14+."What does it take to become a trainer? I am thinking of ethics tests actually. As you already hinted with rogues, an evil trainer might prove to be disastrous. Don't the children have to undergo some tests to be allowed to get a pokemon?"Yes, a trainer's license requires a number of tests and demonstrations of skill. I skipped over all that because otherwise the start of the story would be much, much longer: I figured the requirements would be implied through the knowledge and skills that Red and the gang have at the start of their journey."What about guns and other weapons? With such high technology as pokeballs and I think you also mentioned normal cars, why are there no weapons to fend off pokemon? Why are they never mentioned. Even simple things like arrowheada drowned in spores of plant pokemon, could keep most pokemon in check. So yeah that is actually a major flaw I think."So the simplest answer to the question of guns in the pokemon world is that they were just never invented. There aren't any in the games, and they're not really used in the anime, outside of appearing once in awhile without solving any actual problems that come up. But even if they were invented, they would not be all that useful.Remember that pokemon are not regular animals: some breathe fire or shoot lightening. Others have skin as hard as rock or steel, or are made of poisonous slime, or are ghosts. Others are incredibly fast, and can attack from underground.The idea of people using guns against them seems like it would work out okay in some situations and not at all in others. The same applies even more for swords or bows. In the pokemon world, the deadliest thing you can hold in your hand is a pokeball, because inside it is a monster that can be at least as powerful as the ones you face. Any trainer that decides to carry a sword into battle is just gimping themselves, because that's one less hand they can use for swapping pokemon or applying medicine or catching enemy pokemon."Why does meat seem to be so easily available? How do they manage to mass produce pidgeys or even fearows? (Bill ate Tauros steak, but i guess that is expensive.) Isn't that ridiculously dangerous? And the space required for a fearow farm would be enormous. I guess they cannot just be kept in a crammed space as the would like fight and kill each other."It's dangerous, but not that dangerous: remember that once pokemon are caught, they're mostly tamed, so it's much easier to train them for breeding and raise them and their children for slaughter."So how do you think the cities we know from the game map came to be?... how are the cities politically bonded, what makes a region a region? Have there ever been wars? Big questions, I know... Are we going to hear about it some time?"This will definitely be explored more as the story goes on, but the quick answer here is that before the modern era, the warlords of the pokemon world controlled certain areas of land by being the strongest tamers of pokemon in them, and having underlings that were also strong trainers. Around them grew the most prosperous and well fortified towns and eventually cities, and the regions were formed as alliances between city lords grew to protect against invasion by pokemon or other humans. Eventually this system of government became more democratic and progressive as technology allowed more people to capture and train pokemon and allowed for better infrastructure and communication, but the idea of powerful trainers acting as their city's protectors still exists, and the feudal lords of the olden times are now basically Gym Leaders, but with more divisions of political power.Hope that satisfactorily answers your questions, and thanks for reading!

I was finishing the chapter after a night sleep and I didn't immediately understand why Red suddenly wants to donate his abras. I mean it's noble of him but it comes out a bit out of nowhere (so I think at the moment).And then as I finish the chapter, the realization hit me like a train. He's giving away abras to rangers not only to take on his grief by doing something his father would have been proud of, but also to give rangers better chance of survival so their family won't have to live what he's been through.Damn, it's beautiful and sad and awesome.

This seems like a solvable problem. Make a special design of pokeball that is very distinctive and clearly labelled, then carry it on your person. Personalise it so that it will only work on one specific person - the easy way to do it would be to reshape the ball into a bracelet or choker or something like that, and have it only work if it hasn't been taken off since it was last activated (using a standalone device that can analyse a blood sample, so that it only works on someone with the right DNA).Include a wearable monitoring device that will activate the "ball" if the wearer's life signs are failing (and let the wearer choose how much risk to take for heart rate, breathing, brain activity and so on), and will also send out an alert saying where and when the device activated. Then sell safety bracelets and insurance to cover the costs of retrieval and storage (and maybe legal cover, too, to put the fear of lawyers into anyone who interferes).Yes, you could hack these to murder people (much like hacking a pacemaker), but a pokedex can analyse the contents of a ball and it will look pretty damn fishy if there's no obvious cause of death. And the safety precautions would make it no more dangerous to the general public than an ordinary pokeball that can be hacked to capture a human, and much less dangerous than a pokeball that contains a pokemon trained to kill humans.

Even if pokeball tech can be reshaped into a choker or bracelet or something (which there's no reason to think it can, certainly nothing like that has ever shown up in the games, and I can't recall any in the anime), overcoming the technological challenges would still leave the social and legal ones. People may be allowed to choose to go into a pokeball of their own volition, but it's still illegal to make one specifically for that purpose.

They didn't publicly announce it, I don't think they actually reported how many each person caught. New abra wouldn't have anywhere to teleport to, since they can only teleport back to places they've been, but it's hard to breed them in large part because, unlike the games, you can't breed a pokemon that has just been hatched, they have to actually grow to a mature age, and for some pokemon that can take years, if not decades.Glad you're enjoying it so much so far!

This seems like a pretty easy problem to resolve. Sabrina doesn't have to repay Red immediately. They should be able to agree a reasonably fair exchange, so that Sabrina can try to learn Red's copying trick immediately (or as soon as he works out how to teach it) and Red can receive his reward when he's skilled enough to make proper use of her lessons (or if he discovers some crippling problem that he needs her help to cure).I'm surprised that Sabrina isn't more eager to learn this trick or have Red demonstrate it to an anonymous stranger (i.e. Mazda) ASAP. That suggests that Mazda has already escaped. The appearance of the Cerulean Cave suggests that he has done so, but there's been no mention of a Tier 1 incident on Cinnabar Island, nor any other sign that Mazda is loose.I'm also somewhat confused about why Mazda doesn't seem to have spent more time learning medicine, particularly genetics, and riding in the minds of pokemon that can heal themselves. One attempt to learn Recover from a single Alakazam seems like far too little effort.

It's not the timing of the repayment that matters, it's the time investment of the learning/teaching for them at all. Even if Red just banks his private lessons or whatever, he would still need to put a lot of time aside to teach her in a way that's effective.As for Mazda's medical knowledge, maybe I didn't make it clear, but the alakazam test was not the only one they tried, and he does indeed try and understand genetics and medicine as best he can.

I might be mistaken, but I think your maths is wrong.Chance of Tier 1 being reported accurately = 79 / (79+33) = .71Chance of Tier 2 being reported accurately = 67 / (21+67) = .76This assumes that the base rates of reported-tier-1 and reported-tier-2 are equal, which is not in the given information (and is in fact false).Notation: in the following, {R₁} is the event "incident is reported as Tier 1" and {T₁} is the event "incident is later established to be Tier 1". P(A|B∧C) denotes the probability of A given (B and C).To calculate P(T₁|R₁∧Tyranitar) without having (say) P(R₁|T₁∧Tyranitar), we have to assume that the P(Rᵢ|Tⱼ) are independent of Tyranitar. (In fact, what the Rangers should do is instead filter their data to just Tyranitar incidents that were reported as Tier 1, and count how many were actually Tier 1. Naïvely this directly gives P(T₁|R₁∧Tyranitar), but since there might not be very much data — we have only 17 points in the whole set {Tyranitar}, and presumably only a few of those were reported-tier-1, so {R₁∧Tyranitar} is tiny — we want to make use of our base-rate knowledge to get a Beta prior which our few {R₁∧Tyranitar} data can then update.)So, under that assumption, we want to compute the base rates, and the information we have is as follows:P(T₁|R₁) = 0.79, P(T₁|R₂) = 0.33, P(T₁) = 0.64. (And all the complements thereof implied by {T₁∨T₂} and {R₁∨R₂} being exhaustive.)Now, we can't apply Bayes' Rule directly to get P(R₁|T₁), because we don't have P(R₁) which we would need in order to find P(R₁∧T₁). Instead, we Bayes-expand the conditional probabilities we do have, finding that P(T₁|R₁) = P(T₁∧R₁) / P(R₁) and P(T₂|R₁) = P(T₂∧R₁) / P(R₁). Rearranging, P(R₁) = P(T₁∧R₁) / P(T₁|R₁) = P(T₂∧R₁) / P(T₂|R₁).This gives us our first equation: we substitute in the known values and rearrange to find that 0.21 P(T₁∧R₁) = 0.79 P(T₂∧R₁). We can do the same with the |R₂ numbers to find that 0.67 P(T₁∧R₂) = 0.33 P(T₂∧R₂). This gives us two equations in four unknowns, which isn't enough — we need more constraints!Fortunately, we also have the base rates P(T₁) and P(T₂), and we know that {R₁∨R₂} is exhaustive. So, P(T₁∧R₁) + P(T₁∧R₂) = P(T₁) = 0.64, and P(T₂∧R₁) + P(T₂∧R₂) = P(T₂) = 0.36. We now have four equations, which is enough for a solution.Writing A = P(T₁∧R₁), B = P(T₁∧R₂), C = P(T₂∧R₁) and D = P(T₂∧R₂), we have:A + B = 0.64C + D = 0.360.21*A - 0.79*C = 00.67*B - 0.33*D = 0This gives us a 4x4 matrix which, good news, is invertible. When we solve the system of equations (I used an online matrix calculator, because inverting 4x4 matrices by hand is tedious torture) we get the following:A = 2449 / 4600B = 495 / 4600C = 651 / 4600D = 1005 / 4600So now at last we can compute P(R₁|T₁) = A / (A + B) = 2449 / 2944 ~= 0.83, and P(R₁|T₂) = C / (C + D) = 651 / 1656 ~= 0.39. As a quick check we can also compute our original three pieces of information P(T₁|R₁) = 2449 / 3100 = 0.79, P(T₁|R₂) = 495 / 1500 = 0.33, and P(T₁) = 2944 / 4600 = 0.64, and also check that A + B + C + D = 1.Huzzah, we have the base rates: about 83% of Tier 1s are correctly reported, as are about 61% of Tier 2s. (This also tells us that P(R₁) = A + C = 3100 / 4600 ~= 0.67: about 67% of all incidents are reported as Tier 1s.)Now we can apply Bayes' Rule to combine our P(Tᵢ|Tyranitar) with our P(R₁|Tᵢ∧Tyranitar) (which, you will recall, we are assuming to equal P(R₁|Tᵢ)) to find P(T₁|R₁∧Tyranitar), as follows:P(T₁|R₁∧Tyranitar) = P(R₁∧T₁∧Tyranitar) / P(R₁∧Tyranitar)= P(R₁|T₁∧Tyranitar) * P(T₁∧Tyranitar) / (P(R₁|T₁∧Tyranitar) * P(T₁∧Tyranitar) + P(R₁|T₂∧Tyranitar) * P(T₂∧Tyranitar))= (2449/2944) * (2/17) / ((2449/2944) * (2/17) + (651 / 1656) * (15/17))~= 0.098 / (0.098 + 0.347)= 0.098 / 0.445~= 0.22So our conclusion is that given that a Tyranitar incident was reported as Tier-1, and assuming that Tyranitar incidents are reported with the same accuracy as incidents in general, then there's about a 22% chance that the incident really is a Tier-1.But this is a really long and tedious calculation, requiring a matrix inversion — maybe it'd make more sense to change the given information in the story (say, give P(R₁) rather than P(T₁)) than to have Leaf work all this out ;-)

I'm not sure, but I think that Blue's first command was Bulldoze. I think he saw that the graveller was stronger than he'd expected, predicted that he'd need to poison it in order to avoid losing to Seismic Toss, and managed that by having Rive use Poison Jab instead of Horn Attack. Horn Attack should be Atoh, not Atah, and I think Blue has keyed Poison Jab to Atah instead of Ajop so that he can use it secretly.

This is actually about the review I just posted on fanfiction.net. I just re-read it and realized that at certain points, I was being too forceful, atapoints just straight out telling you what to do withyour story. This was not intentional, but it just came out that way Due to my lack of editing options on my device, I'd like to apologise in advance before you read it, in case you come to think of me as a snob.Also the first clause of the review is a lie.

"That said, I could probably add some thoughts from Blue to add more character to them and their teams."..... Yeeaah, that's kinda the problem here. That isn't a good way to develop characters. In fact, it would actually detract from the story. That's called character shilling. The more you talk about a person's character trait, the less legitimate and stand out it will feel. It's a nice way of rewarding a character to show his development but, your characters are constantly getting rewarded, and it definitely should not be a way to introduce a character to us. But most importantly it is a violation of show, don't tell.Also, I feel I wasn't that clear on what I meant by the importance of Pokemon. I meant that a person's pokemon should be a reflection be of the character, as a character's Pokemon don't only count as a their pet, it's also their 'power', their hobby, their goal, the only constant thing they have to interact with throughout their journey. Thus I feel they should be more important than just facts about the character, to be listed off. I feel that they should be tied to the character, like their hairstyle or the way they wear their clothing. They should be of emotional importance. Which character would choose which Pokemon, what kind of character would choose to use certain types of Pokemons, all of these signal us in to the character of the.... well, character. Thus, when they're just seemingly randomly chosen for each character, rather than customized, it feels like a bit of a let down.Also, with the flow of the story. It feels like you go too easy on the characters. Most of the time they're in a group, so they have a net of safety which makes it feel less like a harsh journey into the wildernesses, and more like a group expedition. This isn't helped by them planning their encounters, giving them an additional safety net. Character weakness is story strength, and I feel like a knowledge of shadow archetypes would help you immensely. Furthermore, the characters are rewarded too much, they haven't gotten past the third gym and they're already known throughout their region. Character rewarding is not as compelling as character punishment to test the character.

Nothing you're saying here is incorrect, the only problem is that I'm intending this to be a somewhat realistic story, and that realism makes itself known in a number of ways in the differences between a trainer's journey here and in other stories. One of those ways is that people don't actually have the luxury to build a team that reflects their character. This is not a game, to them. The team they use to journey in the wilds is not a fashion statement. They're catching and training pokemon in part to accomplish their lifelong ambition, and also in part to *survive.*Now, when a trainer has been on their journey for years, or is already an established presence, that's a different situation. I'm pretty sure Blue has already referenced the "ideal team" that he has in mind at some point, though without all the particulars. Once a trainer is a veteran, *then* they can pick and choose from all the pokemon they've ever had the opportunity to catch and specifically train up and organize their team with things like personal preference and preferred style in mind. After your original review, I actually went back and edited the chapter a bit, and one of the lines I added is that Glen actually has enough pokemon that his preference for slower, bulkier pokemon is showing through. But he still compromises that to adapt to the situation they're in.That means that, yes, most trainers are often using a seemingly random set of pokemon. A few favorites will stay consistent, but past that, you're going to see a lot of common/generic/boring pokemon showing up more often than the popular ones, and you're going to see a mishmash that's more about ensuring a well-rounded team than fitting any specific theme. If you've ever played a Nuzlocke playthrough, I'm basically picturing teams like those often have as what most trainers in this world use for most of their journeys.Now, none of this excuses violations of "show, don't tell," and none of it excuses weak characterization. But I hope that explains why your expectation for the story may not match my vision of what a realistic pokemon world looks like, compared to many other fanfiction out there.As for the characters being in too much safety or being rewarded too much, I can only say that the story's not done yet :) If it's not exciting enough because you'd rather they be put in more danger and struggle against more adversity more often, I can understand that, but I also don't want to shuttle them from one near-death experience to another every time something happens. Again, trying for a realistic story means that starts to strain credulity at a certain point, and I'd rather reserve the really dangerous situations for ones like, well, this chapter, rather than artificially create tension at, say, the pineco capture, when instead they could use their group efforts and careful planning to demonstrate what intelligent trainers can do. Does that make sense?

it's not exciting enough because you'd rather they be put in more danger and struggle against more adversity more often, That's not what I meant at all. It's easier if you think of danger as threat of something happening, while punishment is the thing actually happening. Punishment acts as an subconscious buff to the threats, it shows to the audience how far as a writer you are willing to go. There's a firm difference between you telling the audience something could happen and the audience believing you. For example, if the next chapter has something threatening blue's life, I am not going to believe that Blue's life is in real danger. What I would believe is blue's Pokemon being in danger.The thing is, your story does have punishments, with the two girl that died in the fire. The problem with your 'in-story' punishments is that they're never direct enough. They all have the cautionary tale feeling, so the affect is dulled. It's like "those things happen to other people, in other genres, not to our protagonists."Negative events happening is also essential for pacing. I believe this video will do a better job of explaining this point than I can. Spoilers for game of thrones bytheway.https://www.youtube.com/wat...people don't actually have the luxury to build a team that reflects their characterWhy don't they? I mean, if this is their lifelong ambition, they don't have to particularly hurry or make do with what they have. Hell, pokeballs are seemingly cheap as hell and our heroes rest for weeks or months at every city. If the Pokemon they choose are going to determine how good they're going to be at their careers as they train them for their whole lives and the Pokemon they depend on for their survival, what sense does it to just pick whatever random Pokemon you find on your first walk? Also, I feel like you misunderstood what I meant by personalizing each pokemon, but in order to fully explain that, I'd have to go into OEIs (Objects of Emotional Importance) and that is just way too complicated for a single comment.Non-storytelling stuffThe world building clashes here a bit. See, you want to portray a world that's in constant disaster from Pokemon and that's okay. However you simultaneously portray a world full of comfort and advanced science. There's cars, newpapers, Poketwitter, internet articles and forums, foreign restuarants etc. This mixture makes both worlds unbelievable. Why is there so much talk over an internet opinion piece about mueseums when people die everyday to wildlife. Why isn't there roads or a metro or at least something resembling infrastructure between cities if we have internet? Hell, where's all the agriculture, it's like 'shiny civilization' followed immediately by "OHMYGODEVERYTHINGISABEAR"If like half of the youth( lowballing here) want to have an official league position, which in total consists of 12 for a region (E4, champ, Gym leader), then isn't that like half your youth population gunning for a spot on the national football team with no backups? I mean, even on an island like Kanto, that must result in thousands of teens without any other qualifications for other jobs. Also given how many people are gunning for their jobs and CAN take them if they're strong enough, how are the gym leaders holding onto their jobs for any amount of time? How are most of them even competent at anything other than fighting pokemon battles, if the only qualification to becoming one is to be good at poke battles?Also, this is an extraordinarily late reply bacause I kept losing it due to my browser hating me..

Sorry, but this chapter finally shattered my SoD regarding the age of the main characters. The only way to reconcile it was by deciding that in my headcanon the Pokemon world needs 450 days to cycle around their sun (~25% longer than our real Earth).Because even if you take into account how a harsh world makes them more mature and responsible kids and how the protagonists are all prodigies raised by prodigies, there's no way an 11-12 year old has a crush and a plan on how to deal with it in this way.Look how Red's otherworldly cousin Harry dealt with a good friend having a crush on him around the same age.

Suggestion: A persistent floating widget with the trainers and their pokemons: with the trainer-given-name and its corresponding pokemon-universe-name would be very handy.

Why is it that dark trainers can't teleport? Especially if teleport can be used to bring more than one person at a time, it would seem you only need to get a teleport taxi.

After reading about all the death and destruction and all the people who either have no pokemon or entirely untrained pokemon...I feel like Kanto and all the other regions should operate like Israel. Mandatory military service (in this case trainer service I guess?) complete with some kind of basic training for using pokemon to help in these sorts of situations, how to train pokemon well, a lot of the training Vermillion gym already does... That way, everyone in the region should have some pokemon on them at all times and some basic knowledge about how to use them. They'll remember that training for the rest of their lives, and then there'd be fewer people who are in need of rescuing.

A possiblity. Not saying it's what happened or even likely, but Aiko could have teleported away, thereby removing her from Red's psychic sense. Unfortunately the fact she didn't call Red makes it slightly less likely unless her phone was broken.

A possibility I also think likely. The lack of a phone call is not unusual. It has been mentioned that cellular networks are down. Red should have noticed the abra briefly though. It would explain why the people were gone immediately instead of lasting a short agonizing time.

I am TOTALLY going to read this soon, but… the last few chapters were so extremely, exhaustingly stressful that I can't *quite* bring myself to start until I'm in the right headspace for more of that.(It's probably not clear—I consider your ability to emotionally engage a reader to the point of fatigue to be a feature, not a bug.)

I'm very interested in flygons. You state that they aren't Flying Type in the sense of the particles, and Giovanni has a bunch of them. Do a sense a Chekhov's Gun? Or am I overthinking it?

----------------------------------------
If I remember, it was discovered that certain Pokémon produced a special "flying" particle spurred by Red's reservations about the typing system. Production of these flying particles became a new way of classifying Flying types, and it was said that Gyarados was thought to not be Flying before in this universe. There is special emphasis on the typing system and its place in a real world setting, however I don't think that it will have any particular significance to the story's progression

Rowan being more than a reference is kind of mind-boggling for me (though I guess it shouldn't be, as this is a fan-fiction).I wonder whether the story has more such characters from stories that I haven't read, or that I failed to notice - mainly because I am always looking for recommendations for amazing stories (like The Dark Wizard Of Donkerk).

In case your comment wasn't directed at me but at Daystar, note that he has a recommendations page - http://daystareld.com/recom....Anyway, here are my best recommendations for people that like HPMOR, Worm and The Dark Wizard of Donkerk (I am yet to read A Practical Guide to Evil) (if you want the full list of my best recommendations, see only the stories that I gave 5 stars here: https://www.goodreads.com/r...* Ward - https://www.parahumans.net/... (I am currently in arc 3, but I guess the high-quality-Wildbow-writing would continue).* Other stuff by Alexander Wales - I haven't read all of his works, but of those I have, I liked these two the most (both are also in Daystar's recommendations page): # Metropolitan Man - https://www.fanfiction.net/... # Worth the Candle - https://archiveofourown.org...* Harry Potter and the Natural 20 - https://www.fanfiction.net/...* Significant Digits - http://www.anarchyishyperbo...* If you don't care about reading stuff that isn't finished and probably will never be, then I would also recommend both of these: # Aeromancer - https://www.royalroad.com/f... # The Game of Champions (if you are into Pokemon fanfictions) - the author decided it isn't good enough, so he deleted it, but (almost?) everyone else thinks it is fantastic. If you want to try it, I can send it to you. (The author doesn't mind if people send it privately, as long as it isn't posted publicly.)

By now I’m starting to dislike Blue as a character. During the first chapters Blue seemed fun. Sure, he was overconfident and ignored the obvious fact that it was foolish to run into a Tier 3 threat with just his starter and a pidgey. Nonetheless, he was still fun to read about. And I also expected some character growth from him, I expected him to wise up, learn his limits, and realize that being suicidal is neither smart nor courageous.Yet by now I’m starting to dislike Blue. Aiko quickly became my favorite character. I liked her more than all the main characters. Blue acts recklessly, he himself manages to always stay alive due to being a main character and having plot armor. Instead it’s his friends who end up dying due to pressure from Blue who forces other people to act in a suicidal manner in a futile attempt to be heroic. Blue is unfit to be a leader. A reckless character getting himself hurt wouldn’t be that annoying, but a reckless leader hurting his followers is annoying to read about.

It is unreal how well thought this is. With Red in Saffron, Blue is absolutely in a state of mind of wanting to avoid it and the gym at all costs for the moment, meaning he'll have to go to Celadon (as its the next closest to Vermilion) for his next gym challenge. Just the way that you manage to come up with these plot details for why Blue takes the same gym order as the games is simply genius. Kudos to you, sir.

This was an interesting chapter.What happened to Vlad and Bretta is only superficially similar to what happened with Red and Aiko. In a gym battle stakes are low. Vlad didn’t get permanently hurt in any way, he didn’t even loose a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The only negative consequence is being forced to stay in a city for a bit longer until the rematch. The overwhelming majority of trainers don’t win all of their eight badges on the first try anyway. Sure, trainers ere emotionally invested in their gym battles and want to win them without rematches, but that’s all.I can think of rational reasons why a trainer might choose to stay by their friend’s side in a gym battle. It can offer emotional support to a friend who would otherwise have to be alone while watching their pokemon get massacred. If the two teammates are also traveling companions, it makes sense to stick together, because both will have to stay in the city untilthe rematch anyway.I can easily imagine Red choosing to stay by his partner’s side in a gym battle. I can also imagine Vlad choosing to leave a teammate in a life and death situation. What somebody chooses to do in a gym battle where the stakes are much lower isn’t a reliable proxy for what they would choose to do when facing a certain death.

By the way, I looked at “Pokemon Team Roster 2,” and there were some oddities. Didn’t Blue catch a Steelix? Wasn’t Zephyr supposed to know Brave Bird? I think I remember Eevee using Double Edge at some point. And Charmeleon used some fire-from-his-mouth attack while fighting the Magneton. And Leaf’s Venonat (Ruby) practiced using Sleep Powder while Leaf was researching her article on the renegade murder.

Getting to try for the badge again the next day is kind of weaksauce, imo. Assuming this is a televised match, future badge hopefuls can be expected to take this into account in their own attempts. Having to wait the full month to try again would be more of a deterrent and make the choice/sacrifice more meaningful, I think.

The Mazda interludes. We're starting to see some hints of how the Mewtwo & Red plot lines are set up to converge, and it's going to be epic. Mazda is a complex character, which makes it difficult to predict exactly how the final showdown will play out.

So if I'm following correctly, Daniel just revealed that he has a deep understanding of mind merging and is able to completely hide this from Sabrina and all the other psychics. And what gave him away was being unable to resist a childish practical joke to make everyone think about cookies?I find the therapy sections too long.

Great chapter, as usual! So many threads coming together. When the renegade concept came up again in this context, it was both surprising and completely appropriate. I can't help but think of how all the new partition stuff could relate to pokemon (and human) typing.And then you leave us with two cliffhangers - I'm psyched (pun intended) to see what happens with Red's potential involvement with Mazda, and what Blue and his team were up to in Celadon during the Rocket raid. Well done, and thanks!

I started reading ch. 1 a few months ago and have just now caught up. I came to this story having read several of the most popular rationalist works, but I haven't spent much time in the Pokemon universe except for GO. As a result, I've probably missed some finer points of the research and world (re)building that you put into creating such a rational branch of the Pokemon world.I'm currently enjoying this like I enjoyed HPMoR. I specifically like how realistic your protagonists feel. Sure, they're really smart, but they still make relatable mistakes and learn from each other and their adult mentors in a way that Harry was too perfect for. I wonder if many people who never got past Harry's attitude would find your characters more likable.Another thing that really sets your story apart for me is that you've written so many characters to be understood. I can see what drives them and sympathize even when I disagree. This may be an aspect of rational fiction, but it also just seems like good writing.I'm looking forward to seeing where you take this!

Thank you for making Steven gay. As a trans person, I am always happy whatever I see LGBTQIA+ characters in stories.Speaking of Hoenn characters, I always imagined that Tate and Liza were identical twins with one of them being a trans person.

That's an interesting idea :) I'm treating Tabitha as trans in the story, since their newest character design looks androgynous to me and the name confusion between their Japanese/English ones can be explained as their pre/post transition names, though genderqueer might fit better.

One thing that interests me is how the gym system manages to produce competent social leaders. It's been addressed before, but such a feudal system would seem to favor those who value battling above anything else, so much so that taking the time to start a sociopolitical movement may be detrimental to a trainer's career, assuming that the champion truly is the best and most dedicated trainer. If the champion were not the most dedicated/talented then surely that person could then become champion? Though perhaps they just don't want it.I know it's been addressed with the story about Saffron gym and the strong but inept fighting type leader that Sabrina defeated, and in this chapter Erika's focus on social issues becomes a strength in that her more dedicated gym third can defend her title, but surely there must eventually be a barbaric champion who simply dedicates 100% of their time to battling and becomes champion just for the status, no?What happens when the champion is some undefeatable opponent who doesn't care about the region, refuses to give up his title for the greater good, and pulls rank to do harm? Again, we assume that this is the most dedicated and talented trainer in the world so there is no latent professor oak or other to put them in their place. Such is the flaw of a feudal system.


COMMENT #3
Author: Damon Sasi
Date: November 01, 2020 at 09:08 PM
----------------------------------------
In those cases I think what would tend to happen is that the responsibilities of being Champion would ultimately drive them away; like each of these positions needs to some degree a person who wants to spend their time working with/helping others. Someone who just wants the title can get it then give up the position.But it is possible, and it's a risk of the system.


COMMENT #4
Author: dreary_dugong
Date: November 01, 2020 at 09:40 PM
----------------------------------------
Yeah, that's fair. I imagine that if a champion were to neglect their responsibilities long enough, then some subset of the region's elites, gym leaders, trainers, citizens, government, etc would force them to resign. It's still interesting to think about though.

Funny how the story is following the original games almost beat by beat and it still manages to surprise me. I really look forward to reading how this particular plot point turns out, it has a lot of potential!

I like the description you gave TMs, though I have a lot of questions. Are TMs reusable in this world like they are since gen V games? Or is that just a DRM thing? Are HMs in this too/is that what is being referred to as made by Bill?

You can buy a non-reusable one, which is basically a DRM thing, or just one that's done at a TM console in a store, but most are reusable. HMs don't explicitly exist as a separate thing from TMs. Bill is mentioned as someone well known for creating a lot of very powerful and widely used TMs.

Maybe kind of a spoiler below? Beware.The moment I read the words "Duncan Sabien", my intuition was screaming at me "The probability that this character is going to fuck up anything is virtually zero. They are going to just be awesome".I guess you thought about this issue (i.e., that some people would guess you think highly of Duncan, and that would spoil a bit the mystery of not knowing what kind of a character he is going to be), and decided it is worth it. I wonder whether it does worth it, though (my problem is that I don't know what the pros for doing this are). The difference between this and, say, reading an HP fanfic and knowing from the start that McGonagall is going to be amazing, is that the author could theoretically decide to do something surprising, and actually have a shitty McGonagall for a change.Of course, I still enjoyed the dojo scene (and the rest of the chapter). This wall of text is just a thought that I felt like sharing.

An interesting thought I had: could someone teleport while holding one of Giovanni's great balls? Presumably they could, right, since you can teleport with pokeballs even when they contain dark Pokemon and since Red has that whole plan to teleport to Bill's with a dying friend in a container. That means that Bill's secret research into containing humans is even more interesting though since it could unlock mass teleportation as well as the aforementioned forward time travel.I wonder if Giovanni's ex-renegade slave business is also a good source of test subjects for reanimating contained humans and if he's looking into that.

I was always curious how a face off between Red and Giovanni would go. Making the main villain the face of rationalism in a rationalist story was always a bold choice but I really think it works out here. Now I most look forward to Blue's confrontation of Giovanni when the time comes.

I like the idea of debating it. Obviously it depends on your values. If all you value is rationality and saving the most lives possible no matter the cost then I think you could make the case that Giovanni isn't a villain. Even then though, you'll need to contend with all of the murders and deceptions he's committed and facilitated just to not get any results (that great ball scene is absolutely terrifying). So many people dead to capture a storm God and they're all still out there making more events like Viridian and Vermilion. All that work with Archie and Maxie just for the two of them to nearly destroy the world. All those abuses to Mazda for nothing. At this rate, he's doing more harm than good despite his intentions. I could go on, but that's the core of it.

I always enjoy the little moments of foreshadowing sprinkled in for people with knowledge of the games. The idea of Blue training his Abra into an Alakazam is quite interesting indeed. My all time favorite though is from some chapters back when Glen mentions to Blue that facing Giovanni at his strongest would be challenging him for leadership.

Alright... so a new species is attacking cinnabar... my guesses are either Mewtwo came back (unlikely in my mind), the unown have made something happen there with giratina (very unlikely, as Mewtwo seemed to witness their convergence somewhere in the wilderness), or they have resumed trying to recreate Mewtwo and have started creating ditto (most likely to me).

The ditto of course breeding rapidly and transforming at will into native species and causing havoc on a large scale. Quite possibly Giovanni and Blaine will actually induce the eruption of the volcano in order to contain it, leading to the small island from GSC

Alright!I called it!Ditto rampaging after being created as a byproduct of the cloning, and Giovanni having a plan to "erupt" the island leading to the GSC Cinnabar layout. I forgot how much I liked the few Shaw PoV chapters we have gotten so far. Really good character.Feeding on wild pokemon is a very cool aspect of Ditto that seems obvious in hindsight. I think because i have always just thought of ditto as the perfect breeder, I never considered that it is also the perfect predator once it can basically infiltrate a community/nest. Gives new meaning to the "Imposter" ability.My favorite line of the chapter:“Ditto that for C18.”I knew I had called it at that point.

Brilliant chapter, as always."It also can revoke a trainer license, in rare cases where the person’s focus turns more to gaining money or status than becoming a stronger trainer; the League decided long ago not to subsidize those simply trying to game the system."I'm interested to see your take on competitive battle facilities like The Battle Frontier. Perhaps especially the Battle Tree which I believe Blue canonically has a hand in starting. Seems to me like they'd waste a lot of talent and resources that could be devoted to defense rather than purely strategic battling with little practical value.

Good tips. I feel like these tactics aren't often discussed openly, but it's just assumed that people will figure them out on their own.One I might add is the importance of signaling. Both kids and adults rely heavily on certain signals (clothes, activities, spending time with the right people) to navigate their role in society. In my own experience a lot of conflicts come from the parties wanting to project different images, but that doesn't often come up during the argument. I think signals can actually be a good place to negotiate and compromise (e.g. I'll wear nice clothes to Gramma's if I can wear what I want with my friends).

Man, this is giving me all the same sort of super uneasy feelings that I got while reading Pact. Which is a good thing. I couldn't stand to live in a world where you have to have constant vigilance, especially against creatures lime the fae. The stress would drive me mad, or to suicide.I suppose that's as good an endorsement of your writing quality as anything.

Beautiful story! Self harm is a really sensitive topic, but the way you incorporate it seems so authentic and avoids the cliches. I really felt the turmoil of the characters.The world building in this short story was really tight too. It felt like there's a lot of depth to this world, but you only flesh it out where it's important to the story.I think that's a sign of a good writer. That was a great ending along the same lines-we get closure of the immediate issues but are left imagining where out will go from here. It's somehow optimistic but also realistic.5/5!

People have different definitions for a “nice person.” For example, I consider my current partner nice. I’m happy with how he treats me, he is caring, etc. Yet I know for sure that many other people wouldn’t call him nice. He doesn’t do anything even remotely romantic. (That’s fine with me; I also perceive romantic behaviors as a boring waste of time.) He can be argumentative and harsh with words. (That’s also fine, I am just as argumentative, and the two of us met in a university’s debate club.) He isn’t funny at all. (I like that, my ability to understand jokes is abysmally bad, and communication is simpler when I don’t have to struggle with deciphering other people’s figurative language.) And so on.Most people can agree upon some extreme forms of non-niceness (like domestic abuse), but beyond that, people’s definitions differ.Also, I have to somewhat disagree with the idea that getting sex is easier with a female body. I came out as trans when I was 23, and before that I lived as a woman. Moreover, I qualified as attractive. Nonetheless, in my late teens/early twenties I spent a lot of time unsuccessfully trying to get laid and feeling just as frustrated as any other guy. In fact, people telling me that getting laid must be easy with a body like mine only made me feel worse about my failure to get laid.Here’s the problem—an attractive female body makes it easy to get sex only with a specific subset of men who engage in certain behaviors. Sure, some men approached me, complimented my appearance, tried to flirt with me. Yet every time that happened, I inwardly recoiled and wanted to do nothing with this dude. I have nothing against casual sex if it means some no-strings-attached pleasure for both people who mutually treat each other nicely. But that’s not what these men offered me. They treated me like a piece of meat that’s available for sale. While complimenting me, they dissected the appearance of each of my body parts. It felt like they saw me as just a collection of pretty body parts. Moreover, it felt like they didn’t even want mutual pleasure, it felt like they wanted me as a checkmark in their list of conquests that would allow them to boost their egos.Finding a partner I like took me plenty of time and effort. I had a crush on a guy from university (whom I had known for months by then). Although he accepted my invitations to dates pretty much instantly, it still took me months of dating to get him in my bed. It turned out that he was shy, and wasn’t comfortable with instantly jumping in bed. I would have been fine with things progressing faster, but he wasn’t. Once you exclude a certain subset of men (who engage in some behaviors that I perceive as unpleasant), a female body no longer helps getting laid faster.This reminds me the odd stereotype that heterosexual men have more extramarital affairs than heterosexual women. It’s inherently impossible, because you would just have to ask with whom exactly are these men sleeping then.Similarly, if a dude has to spend months dating a woman before he gets sex, doesn’t that imply that said woman also had to spend months before she got sex? If heterosexual guys have to get though countless frustrating failed dates before they finally find a partner they love, weren’t there women who also participated in these disappointing dates?

Hmm, good point! A modality is basically a specific method of treatment, as compared to a single intervention. I'll edit that explanation in now, thanks :)

The added explanation is great, IMHO.Just in case it wasn't on purpose, note that you first mention the term 'modalities' earlier: "modalities such as Transference-Focused Psychotherapy"

Yeah, I figured that was the best place to add a fuller definition since earlier than that it was probably enough to glean from context that it just meant "method of therapy" :)

The lack of an introductory paragraph that laid out what this article was supposed to be about was confusing, and rather off-putting. Other than that, the writing was great and the ideas flowed very well. Just try to tell the reader what the article is about in order to hook the intended audience. The introduction isn't just something that English teachers tell you to use for all your essays, it is actually important. In other word, the group that you stated at the beginning (beginning to advanced gamers) might be interested, but a far more interested audience would probably be writers for games and other media forms.

I figured the paragraph it starts with served as that, but I've updated it to be more explicit. How does it read now?And yes, this can also be applied to other storytelling medium. I originally worded a lot of it to be specific for tabletop RPGs however (players, GM), so I might edit it at some point to make it more applicable to any fiction writer.

Yeah, this answers my question really well. It read really well already, and this makes the idea even clearer. Thanks for taking the time to adjust it!

Why were the rebel ships running out of fuel? They're moving through a vacuum, so they don't need constant usage of fuel to go in a straight line! Speaking of which, until I get a better explanation of hyperspace other than 'really fast,' I would like to know how they decelerate from hyperspace. I can (almost) deal with the inertia problems since they're generating artificial gravity anyway, but there has to be engines in the front of the ship just to get back to normal speed.

Heh, didn't even think of that. Maybe they had to keep tapping the thrusters to stay head of the Order, who kept speeding up too?As for hyperspace, I just assumed that they travel through some extra dimensional space (hence the name) that they then just drop out of at a different point. The idea of *actually just flying through space really fast* has a ton of other problems.

Well Solo kinda messed that up, because as far as I can tell, hyperfuel = really fast.

Even if there is some inter-dimension thing going on, Solo showed that it also allows for ships to go much faster than usual, in which case there is no reason to decelerate in a vacuum. You should be able to create a process using a specific amount of coaxium/hyperfuel to travel at larger fractions of light speed than previously. It's not quite as annoying as the whole midichlorian thing, but I'm still bothered by it.

You're right, that's a pretty big hole.

There are various factors that influence whether some experience will be traumatic for a person.Here's one example from my own life. Back when I was a small child, I somewhere heard that spanking children is illegal in my country. That meant I was allowed to fight back. And I sure did. I “won” several fistfights against adults. It usually went like this: Some adult wants to discipline me and hits me. I hit back. We exchange a couple of punches. I absolutely refuse to give up—the more they hit me, the more desperately I fight back, totally ignoring the pain from any hits they managed to land on me. The adult realizes that their attempt to discipline me isn’t working—unless they break all my limbs, I won’t give up. At that point the adult gives up. I have “won” the fight. My ego skyrocketed. In my childish naivety, I believed that I must be absolutely amazing if I won a fistfight against an adult (it took me a while to realize that I wasn’t “winning” these fights, adults simply decided to stop). I wasn’t hurt or traumatized, I was absolutely happy. And did I mention my ego skyrocketed after each failed attempt to discipline me? Thus, as a child, through sheer stubbornness, I converted what ought to have been a traumatizing experience into a moment of triumph. Not that there were many such occasions. My mother attempted to spank me exactly once. The end result was her getting bruises. She didn’t try it for the second time. Childhood spanking wasn't traumatizing for me only because of my unique circumstances ("stubborn" just happened to be one of my personality traits).How people react to unpleasant events depends on numerous factors that are out of our control (for instance, in my example I never got to choose my personality traits, I just happened to be the way I was). This is why nobody should ever blame the victim for being too sensitive. You experienced a similar potentially traumatic event and coped with it very well? Congratulations, you got lucky. But you have no right to criticize other people who have experienced a similar event and failed to cope with it equally well, because, after all, other people's unique circumstances can be entirely different than your own.

Good point to bring up; the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves are often influenced by not just what happens to us but how we respond to things, and how successful we are in our responses.

There's a step here that's implied and elided over -- for my money, the hardest part. In order to mentally articulate the thought, "I notice that I am upset," you must have a smidge of distance. Just enough to interrupt the stimulus/response cycle virtually every living creature operates from. Gaining that distance? SO HARD, the most difficult thing I've ever tried in my life.To wit:You have to believe it's possible. You have to believe making conscious choices is better than relying on conditioning and evo-bio firmware. You have to construct a subset of your consciousness and run it in parallel with your stream-of-consciousness (I once heard a poet call this "the shrieks of the lunatics in the asylum"). Then you have to monitor that subset, watch the watcher, to make sure it doesn't fade into the white-noise background of thought. AND THEN you have to conclude that yes, this is actually WORTH contributing these otherwise-idle cycles to constant self-monitoring.These aren't ideas my parents or grandparents or friends or teachers or guidance-counselors shared during my formative years so I had to do all this stuff with my GROWN-UP BRAIN which I suspect makes it harder...?So powerful, though. Having that tiny gap empowers one to choose a response, to override the default programming and make a conscious, virtually always BETTER, choice.I never really believed this was possible, unless maybe you were a Zen monk or a Vulcan. After extensive work with CBT techniques and a lot of support, I can self-observe and even, somewhat consistently, make conscious choices. Absolutely worth the effort and also my preferred explanation for what Socrates meant when he said, "The unexamined life is not worth living."(If you're mired in stimulus/response, are you really CONSCIOUS??)

Agreed with all of the above. Getting that smidgeon of distance is pretty much the only way to really start making "choices" in so far as we can actually make those at all, whereas if someone is not practiced at it they will likely run straight from upsetting stimulus to response in a heartbeat.
