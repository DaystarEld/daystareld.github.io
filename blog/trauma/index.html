            <div class="article-content">
<p>First, a quick definition: I think a useful way to view Trauma as basically a "stuck" central nervous system response to a highly dangerous or frightening situation. There are "smaller" forms of trauma, and more prolonged causes rather than singular events (see: Complex PTSD). But by and large, Trauma is when we get into a situation that triggers a Fight/Flight/Freeze/Fawn response where we feel a lack of control or agency, and whatever way we reacted gets "hard coded" into a reflex that triggers each time we're in a similar situation.</p>
<p>It's almost like the body goes "Well, I have no idea what happened there or what to do about it, and we felt pretty powerless. But it was PRETTY FUCKING SCARY and the thing we did last time at least managed to cause us to survive, so let's just do that again next time anything like it happens."</p>
<p>There's a danger mode that society has been engaging in for years (decades/centuries/millenia?) that simply denied trauma. It was ignorant of trauma, or acted as if it didn't exist, or verbally repudiated it. People were expected to tough out bad things that happened to them. Men especially were not allowed to express it, except (eventually) if it occurred as the result of war.</p>
<p>And maybe this was helped by there just being less trauma all around. Maybe people didn't get into situations they couldn't make sense of as often, or had more robust agency over even shitty things in their lives, or there were more narratives in society that helped people get through such situations without getting stuck.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, the pendulum has swung somewhat, and I hear rumblings of worry about whether we're treating trauma too seriously. If we're over-correcting and making things out to be more traumatic than they "really are," and to what degree trauma is the result of people being told that something that happens to them is "traumatic" or is made a big deal of.</p>
<p>This second failure mode concerning trauma is something like a worry that someone will fall off their bike, scrape their knee, and be taken to the hospital amidst parental tears and shock, thus cementing a lifelong fear of bikes or intolerance of pain.</p>

<p>And while I think this second failure mode is probably true for things like how offended or outraged people get by things, I don't think it's in our sight-lines just yet for "actual trauma." Overprotective parents are a thing, always have been. If a kid falls off their bike, they are much more likely to cry if their parent freaks out.</p>
<p>And yes, to some degree how society treats a thing will inform how people react to it. There are some people who are sexually molested or emotionally abused and essentially move on from it without ever telling anyone, or seeking professional help. This is particularly something you'll hear from people who are older, and grew up before modern perspectives on trauma or awareness of abuse or rape was as prevalent as it is. There's a fairly famous older man who got in some hot water for saying something like "Well, I was raped a number of times at the male boarding school I went to, and it sucked, but that was just a thing that happened. The older boys would do that often to the younger ones. It wasn't the end of the world."</p>

<p>People will look at accounts like this and be somewhat reinforced in believing that the response to traumatic events is moderately, or even largely, to blame for how traumatic it is.</p>

<p>But the thing to remember about trauma is that by its nature it is anti-correlated to reports and disclosures. You will hear more from the people who recovered from traumatic events or were not traumatized by bad events more often than you will those who were. This is axiomatic to what it even means to be traumatized by something vs not.</p>

<p>On top of the other points, like how no two situations are alike, and no two people are alike, and so making a general rule out of anecdotes is dangerous, it's also hard to think of people who are actually traumatized by the response to a thing versus the thing itself. My experience is that Eddie Kaspbraks are really, really rare in real life, even in less stereotypical, absolute incarnations.</p>

<p>What I do run across instead, and quite often, are the "stereotypical" examples of people who have spent years, if not decades, bottling up their trauma and appearing to all observers, even close observers, as if they're okay, or as if the behaviors that they have that are harmful to themselves or others are just the result of who they are, and not what they've gone through, until something comes out and sheds light on dark machinery. Part of that just comes with the territory of my field of work, but even outside of it, that seems to be far more common than the inverse situation.</p>

<p>And when people who go through events others might call traumatizing, but who were not traumatized by it by some combination of factors that are so far unknown, see such people, I worry that their conclusion will be that this is proof that trauma is the result of low willpower or resilience or "grit" or whatever.</p>

<p>The pendulum may well be swinging toward society being too sensitive to traumatic fears and causing more harm than it's preventing in highlighting bad experiences as "traumatic." But so far I don't know that I've seen enough evidence to conclude that for sure, and I hope we get better metrics and tools to determine if that's in fact what's happening before we start encouraging a narrative that might make those who suffer from trauma feel in some way as if it's "all in their head," like society used to.</p>
