<message><![CDATA[<p>The lack of an introductory paragraph that laid out what this article was supposed to be about was confusing, and rather off-putting. Other than that, the writing was great and the ideas flowed very well. Just try to tell the reader what the article is about in order to hook the intended audience. The introduction isn't just something that English teachers tell you to use for all your essays, it is actually important. In other word, the group that you stated at the beginning (beginning to advanced gamers) might be interested, but a far more interested audience would probably be writers for games and other media forms.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>a couple of thoughts regarding the tangela cell and regeneration. <br>the biggest limit regarding rapid regeneration   are telomeres. every cell starts out with a finite length of telomere at the end of their chromosomes, and when it splits (read: regenerates) the remaining telomeres are shortened. when you run out the chromosomes start shortening instead. that is, generally speaking, bad. if you mess with the telomeres, you risk messing with your apoptosis, probably get some cancer and die. if you don't, you'll start spliting cells rapidly, lose your lifetime supply of telomeres in a day, get some cancer and die.<br>the second is the usual mass conservation question. bill said the samples are losing mass. you'd expect them to gain mass instead because he's adding matter to the samples (the acid). sure, the ratio of living matter to nonliving matter should decrease over time, but that's not exactly what he said.</p><p>overall i liked the chapter. i just finished binge reading the whole thing and i'm enjoying it so far, i'm looking forward to seeing where you'll take it.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>well it's been a long time since that course but iirc if you make a cell's telomere arbitrarily long (or use telomerase to constantly lengthen it) you prevent the cell from going into apoptosis, even when it really really should (for instance due to mutation), leading to cancer, death etc. </p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I read up to this point and now I am concerned.  I had no idea updates were only once a month.  Lets see... we are at approximately 1.5 badges.  If we assume the first 6 chapters were all intro then we are left with 32 chapters for 1.5 badges or ~21.3 chapters for each badge.  Assuming that the elite 4 and the mewtwo wrapup will take about the amount of time it will take to get a badge, that is 7.5 badges still to go.  7.5 * 21.3 = 160.  160 / 12 = 13.333.  So expected completion time is 13 years.  Assuming that posts were made twice monthly that drops to 6.5 years.  Weekly, 3.25 years.  Bi-Weekly - 1.625 years.</p><p>I would guess that if the story length is about what I estimate then the odds of completion are very low unless it is updated at least once a week.  I base this simply on my observations of watching people update web based stories.  If anyone has more complete evidence of completion rates versus time and story length I would be glad to see it.</p><p>I would hate to see this story not finished.  I have enjoyed what has come so far very much.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey there! Glad you've been enjoying the story so far.  Yeah, believe me when I say that the amount of time the story will take to complete seems daunting to me as much as anyone!  I can hardly believe I've been writing it for over 3 years already, though I'm very proud that I never missed an update, even given the monthly gap between chapters.</p><p>I don't know if it's possible for me to push out more than a chapter a month without some significant change in my life: right now I'm working full time, and have other projects that I spend time on too. Even if I stopped all other projects, I don't think it would significantly increase my publishing pace: maybe I could publish every 3 weeks if I really pushed myself and dropped all other interests, but I think that would increase the chances of me burning out.</p><p>What I can say is that the pacing of the story so far is not necessarily the pacing it will have throughout. The first badge took 27 chapters to attain: by my current plan, the next one will be done by about chapter 42, and the one after that will probably be done in another 10ish. With the majority of the world and character building out of the way, the plot will be more front-and-center for the story, and I hope that means I can finish it all in about 110-120 chapters.</p><p>That still means I'll have been writing the story for 10 years, which is ridiculous to consider, but then, as a matter of wordcount, when you consider that I'm nearing 300k words after a little over 3 years, that's not all that bad compared to many published series. Even if I never get the kind of following that might allow me to write full time, I am hoping to keep going with it as long as I can, and one day finish :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Here a long review I expect:<br>Over the last month I have read through all the chapters up to this one after finishing hpmor and wanting more of rational fiction. Pokemon was a rather large part of my childhood and with my current rational-esque mindset I was very glad to find this project of yours. I think you are doing a great job in writing this fanfiction. That includes the storytelling (tension and plot and so on) as well as the "consistency of the pokemon world". Before I get to, what I would be very happy to see discussed, I want thank you and congratulate you for the things I found especially pleasing:</p><p>- The plot involving mewto: Your approach is excellent! I love how you see it from its perspective. It is really interesting to experience the coming into existence and initial develepmont of this new sapient creature. As far as I have understood it is very powerful but not hyperintelligent, right? <br>- the rest of the foreshadowing of the greater plot<br>- the admittance to how dangerous pokemon are, especially animal-like legendaries;</p><p>So now to the things I am wondering about or think, are still missing:<br>- The reason CHILDREN ARE SENT OUT ALONE WITH NEW STARTER POKEMON: I mean okay, we are facing a dangerous world, were children are forced to grow up a little earlier. But as far as it seems the cities and towns are somewhat safe and in order and provide a lifestyle comparable to the rich countries in this reality. So it is not a war situation like in some 3rd world countries, where children are kind of coerced into killing and stuff to survive. Even in the middle ages the education to a knight started after the boys had hit an age, where they were at least in puberty! So Red and the others going out with 10/11 seems quite ridiculous. Why do they actually go out right after becoming trainers? Why not train for some years, let the pokemon evolve or so. They would be safer on their journeys that way. <br>And just think about all the education they are missing! Especially for Red it should be quite important. Ok, he is quite ahead with his knowledge but I think there should be still a lot for him to learn. The technology for pokeballs and the high medical standard do not seem trivial. Did he really learn the basics already? Wont he need it for a career in reasearch?<br>And why the need to go alone? What is the harm of a supervisor for such a journey? I mean it is also a loss for society if the children just die after so much money is put into their education and journeing. If not for humanitarian reasons society or the governments should be interested in securing the futures of the trainer childern. Every capable trainer is valuable for the security of the whole society. <br>I think that is all, that currently comes to mind regarding this topic.<br>- What does it take to become a trainer? I am thinking of ethics tests actually. As you already hinted with rogues, an evil trainer might prove to be disastrous. Don't the children have to undergo some tests to be allowed to get a pokemon? <br>- What about guns and other weapons? With such high technology as pokeballs and I think you also mentioned normal cars, why are there no weapons to fend off pokemon? Why are they never mentioned. Even simple things like arrowheada drowned in spores of plant pokemon, could keep most pokemon in check. So yeah that is actually a major flaw I think...<br>- Why does meat seem to be so easily available? How do they manage to mass produce pidgeys or even fearows? (Bill ate Tauros steak, but i guess that is expensive.) Isn't that ridiculously dangerous? And the space required for a fearow farm would be enormous. I guess they cannot just be kept in a crammed space as the would like fight and kill each other. I would be really interested to see some mention of that :)<br>- Now here is more of a harmless question: How do you think civilisation and urbanology works in the pokemon world. We still have only little of the world. You showed us the larger towns and cities but no villages or lone houses -except Bill's but he is special. Do they exist? I suppose, life there should be quite dangerous, unless it is a village full of capable trainers, which are not the most common thing i guess... So how do you think the cities we know from the game map came to be?<br>As far as you have mentioned, there is also no real state or regional government (like the Kanto President or so). So how are the cities politically bonded, what makes a region a regiom? Have there ever been wars? Big questions, I know... Are we going to hear about it some time?</p><p>There are even more little thoughts about this fanfiction on my mind. But let that be it for now. I want to underline that I really like your work and am really looking forward to what is coming. This is in no way meant to be negative, just curiosity and a critical mind. But I guess that is obvious for one, who writes rational fiction. So I hope my comment was helpfull as feedback. You can contact me on facebook if you would like to respond to it.</p><p>Well thanks again and keep up the good work,<br>Emil</p><p></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey there, thanks for the review :) I'm glad you're enjoying the story so much, and am happy to address your questions!</p><p>"Why are the children sent out so young and without supervision on their journeys?"</p><p>This is a great question that I think has no one simple answer. The first obvious point is that I'm trying to rationalize how things work in the pokemon world without changing it too much, which means I can't just make everyone older (as some pokemon fanfiction justifiably does) or have them chaperoned by an adult, which would completely change the dynamic and feel of the "pokemon journey." To me, the goal has to be justifying their custom through the world they're in. So that means getting all the training and education they need in by the age they'd be sent out, having Ranger Outposts along every route ready to respond to distress calls in minutes, and making sure that anyone who goes out young is accompanied by traveling companions (which isn't done in the games just for gameplay reasons).  Red, Leaf and Blue go out at the youngest age anyone does (11) because they're exceptionally gifted, both personally and through circumstance (mentored and equipped by Professors).   Most children in the world still don't go out until they're older, like 14+.</p><p>"What does it take to become a trainer? I am thinking of ethics tests actually. As you already hinted with rogues, an evil trainer might prove to be disastrous. Don't the children have to undergo some tests to be allowed to get a pokemon?"</p><p>Yes, a trainer's license requires a number of tests and demonstrations of skill. I skipped over all that because otherwise the start of the story would be much, much longer: I figured the requirements would be implied through the knowledge and skills that Red and the gang have at the start of their journey.</p><p>"What about guns and other weapons? With such high technology as pokeballs and I think you also mentioned normal cars, why are there no weapons to fend off pokemon? Why are they never mentioned. Even simple things like arrowheada drowned in spores of plant pokemon, could keep most pokemon in check. So yeah that is actually a major flaw I think."</p><p>So the simplest answer to the question of guns in the pokemon world is that they were just never invented. There aren't any in the games, and they're not really used in the anime, outside of appearing once in awhile without solving any actual problems that come up.  But even if they were invented, they would not be all that useful.</p><p>Remember that pokemon are not regular animals: some breathe fire or shoot lightening. Others have skin as hard as rock or steel, or are made of poisonous slime, or are ghosts. Others are incredibly fast, and can attack from underground.</p><p>The idea of people using guns against them seems like it would work out okay in some situations and not at all in others. The same applies even more for swords or bows. In the pokemon world, the deadliest thing you can hold in your hand is a pokeball, because inside it is a monster that can be at least as powerful as the ones you face.  Any trainer that decides to carry a sword into battle is just gimping themselves, because that's one less hand they can use for swapping pokemon or applying medicine or catching enemy pokemon.</p><p>"Why does meat seem to be so easily available? How do they manage to mass produce pidgeys or even fearows? (Bill ate Tauros steak, but i guess that is expensive.) Isn't that ridiculously dangerous? And the space required for a fearow farm would be enormous. I guess they cannot just be kept in a crammed space as the would like fight and kill each other."</p><p>It's dangerous, but not that dangerous: remember that once pokemon are caught, they're mostly tamed, so it's much easier to train them for breeding and raise them and their children for slaughter.</p><p>"So how do you think the cities we know from the game map came to be?... how are the cities politically bonded, what makes a region a region? Have there ever been wars? Big questions, I know... Are we going to hear about it some time?"</p><p>This will definitely be explored more as the story goes on, but the quick answer here is that before the modern era, the warlords of the pokemon world controlled certain areas of land by being the strongest tamers of pokemon in them, and having underlings that were also strong trainers. Around them grew the most prosperous and well fortified towns and eventually cities, and the regions were formed as alliances between city lords grew to protect against invasion by pokemon or other humans. Eventually this system of government became more democratic and progressive as technology allowed more people to capture and train pokemon and allowed for better infrastructure and communication, but the idea of powerful trainers acting as their city's protectors still exists, and the feudal lords of the olden times are now basically Gym Leaders, but with more divisions of political power.</p><p>Hope that satisfactorily answers your questions, and thanks for reading!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Minor things that has me confused: In this chapter it is said that "Pokemon like klink and magnemite seem far too organized to have just popped into existence on their own." as if implying that the origin of these pokemon is not known. However, in chapter 3 we have "when manmade pokemon like magnemite and klink started showing up".</p><p>So it seems to me that the writing here is questioning the previously established fact that magnemite and klink are manmade?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I largely agree with you on this. A question though.</p><p>Have you read the Percy Jackson series?<br>His far and/or future seeing dreams might fit the bill of "prophecy" but are largely used as an author tool to show the readers the greater machinations of the story beyond limiting first person view of Percy Jackson narrating the events of the whole series?</p><p>Do you have a stance on "prophecies" used in that way?</p><p>Edit: Oh and you forgot "The Prophecy the Author would like you to forget ever existed" Where authors accidentally write themselves into corners by having too over-arcing of a prophecy at the beginning, then years later, when their intent for the story/series has been altered over the course of writing it, they suddenly have to deal with the ominous "due-date" of the prophecy that requires x to do y or z to die against then undecided enemy or event.

<message><![CDATA[<p>There's a step here that's implied and elided over -- for my money, the hardest part. In order to mentally articulate the thought, "I notice that I am upset," you must have a smidge of distance. Just enough to interrupt the stimulus/response cycle virtually every living creature operates from. Gaining that distance? SO HARD, the most difficult thing I've ever tried in my life.</p><p>To wit:</p><p>You have to believe it's possible. You have to believe making conscious choices is better than relying on conditioning and evo-bio firmware. You have to construct a subset of your consciousness and run it in parallel with your stream-of-consciousness (I once heard a poet call this "the shrieks of the lunatics in the asylum"). Then you have to monitor that subset, watch the watcher, to make sure it doesn't fade into the white-noise background of thought. AND THEN you have to conclude that yes, this is actually WORTH contributing these otherwise-idle cycles to constant self-monitoring.</p><p>These aren't ideas my parents or grandparents or friends or teachers or guidance-counselors shared during my formative years so I had to do all this stuff with my GROWN-UP BRAIN which I suspect makes it harder...?</p><p>So powerful, though. Having that tiny gap empowers one to choose a response, to override the default programming and make a conscious, virtually always BETTER, choice.</p><p>I never really believed this was possible, unless maybe you were a Zen monk or a Vulcan. After extensive work with CBT techniques and a lot of support, I can self-observe and even, somewhat consistently, make conscious choices. Absolutely worth the effort and also my preferred explanation for what Socrates meant when he said, "The unexamined life is not worth living."</p><p>(If you're mired in stimulus/response, are you really CONSCIOUS??)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Agreed with all of the above.

<message><![CDATA[<p>I might be mistaken, but I <i>think</i> your maths is wrong.<br></p><blockquote>Chance of Tier 1 being reported accurately = 79 / (79+33) = .71<br>Chance of Tier 2 being reported accurately = 67 / (21+67) = .76</blockquote><p></p><p>This assumes that the base rates of reported-tier-1 and reported-tier-2 are equal, which is not in the given information (and is in fact false).</p><p>Notation: in the following, {R₁} is the event "incident is reported as Tier 1" and {T₁} is the event "incident is later established to be Tier 1".  P(A|B∧C) denotes the probability of A given (B and C).</p><p>To calculate P(T₁|R₁∧Tyranitar) without having (say) P(R₁|T₁∧Tyranitar), we have to assume that the P(Rᵢ|Tⱼ) are independent of Tyranitar.  (In fact, what the Rangers <i>should</i> do is instead filter their data to just Tyranitar incidents that were reported as Tier 1, and count how many were actually Tier 1.  Naïvely this directly gives P(T₁|R₁∧Tyranitar), but since there might not be very much data — we have only 17 points in the whole set {Tyranitar}, and presumably only a few of those were reported-tier-1, so {R₁∧Tyranitar} is <i>tiny</i> — we want to make use of our base-rate knowledge to get a Beta prior which our few {R₁∧Tyranitar} data can then update.)</p><p>So, under that assumption, we want to compute the base rates, and the information we have is as follows:</p><p>P(T₁|R₁) = 0.79, P(T₁|R₂) = 0.33, P(T₁) = 0.64.  (And all the complements thereof implied by {T₁∨T₂} and {R₁∨R₂} being exhaustive.)</p><p>Now, we can't apply Bayes' Rule directly to get P(R₁|T₁), because we don't have P(R₁) which we would need in order to find P(R₁∧T₁).  Instead, we Bayes-expand the conditional probabilities we <i>do</i> have, finding that P(T₁|R₁) = P(T₁∧R₁) / P(R₁) and P(T₂|R₁) = P(T₂∧R₁) / P(R₁).  Rearranging, P(R₁) = P(T₁∧R₁) / P(T₁|R₁) = P(T₂∧R₁) / P(T₂|R₁).</p><p>This gives us our first equation: we substitute in the known values and rearrange to find that 0.21 P(T₁∧R₁) = 0.79 P(T₂∧R₁).  We can do the same with the |R₂ numbers to find that 0.67 P(T₁∧R₂) = 0.33 P(T₂∧R₂).  This gives us two equations in four unknowns, which isn't enough — we need more constraints!</p><p>Fortunately, we also have the base rates P(T₁) and P(T₂), and we know that {R₁∨R₂} is exhaustive.  So, P(T₁∧R₁) + P(T₁∧R₂) = P(T₁) = 0.64, and P(T₂∧R₁) + P(T₂∧R₂) = P(T₂) = 0.36.  We now have four equations, which is enough for a solution.</p><p>Writing A = P(T₁∧R₁), B = P(T₁∧R₂), C = P(T₂∧R₁) and D = P(T₂∧R₂), we have:</p><p>A + B = 0.64</p><p>C + D = 0.36</p><p>0.21*A - 0.79*C = 0</p><p>0.67*B - 0.33*D = 0</p><p>This gives us a 4x4 matrix which, good news, is invertible.  When we solve the system of equations (I used an online matrix calculator, because inverting 4x4 matrices by hand is tedious torture) we get the following:</p><p>A = 2449 / 4600</p><p>B = 495 / 4600</p><p>C = 651 / 4600</p><p>D = 1005 / 4600</p><p>So now at last we can compute P(R₁|T₁) = A / (A + B) = 2449 / 2944 ~= 0.83, and P(R₁|T₂) = C / (C + D) = 651 / 1656 ~= 0.39.  As a quick check we can also compute our original three pieces of information P(T₁|R₁) = 2449 / 3100 = 0.79, P(T₁|R₂) = 495 / 1500 = 0.33, and P(T₁) = 2944 / 4600 = 0.64, and also check that A + B + C + D = 1.</p><p>Huzzah, we have the base rates: about 83% of Tier 1s are correctly reported, as are about 61% of Tier 2s.  (This also tells us that P(R₁) = A + C = 3100 / 4600 ~= 0.67: about 67% of all incidents are reported as Tier 1s.)</p><p><strong>Now</strong> we can apply Bayes' Rule to combine our P(Tᵢ|Tyranitar) with our P(R₁|Tᵢ∧Tyranitar) (which, you will recall, we are assuming to equal P(R₁|Tᵢ)) to find P(T₁|R₁∧Tyranitar), as follows:</p><p>P(T₁|R₁∧Tyranitar) = P(R₁∧T₁∧Tyranitar) / P(R₁∧Tyranitar)</p><p>= P(R₁|T₁∧Tyranitar) * P(T₁∧Tyranitar) / (P(R₁|T₁∧Tyranitar) * P(T₁∧Tyranitar) + P(R₁|T₂∧Tyranitar) * P(T₂∧Tyranitar))</p><p>= (2449/2944) * (2/17) / ((2449/2944) * (2/17) + (651 / 1656) * (15/17))</p><p>~= 0.098 / (0.098 + 0.347)</p><p>= 0.098 / 0.445</p><p>~= 0.22</p><p>So our conclusion is that <i>given that</i> a Tyranitar incident was reported as Tier-1, and <i>assuming that</i> Tyranitar incidents are reported with the same accuracy as incidents in general, <i>then</i> there's about a 22% chance that the incident really is a Tier-1.</p><p>But this is a really long and tedious calculation, requiring a matrix inversion — maybe it'd make more sense to change the given information in the story (say, give P(R₁) rather than P(T₁)) than to have Leaf work all this out ;-)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Good tips. I feel like these tactics aren't often discussed openly, but it's just assumed that people will figure them out on their own.</p><p>One I might add is the importance of signaling. Both kids and adults rely heavily on certain signals (clothes, activities, spending time with the right people) to navigate their role in society. In my own experience a lot of conflicts come from the parties wanting to project different images, but that doesn't often come up during the argument. I think signals can actually be a good place to negotiate and compromise (e.g. I'll wear nice clothes to Gramma's if I can wear what I want with my friends).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>"That said, I could probably add some thoughts from Blue to add more character to them and their teams."<br>..... Yeeaah, that's kinda the problem here. That isn't a good way to develop characters. In fact, it would actually detract from the story. That's called character shilling. The more you talk about a person's character trait, the less legitimate and stand out it will feel. It's a nice way of rewarding a character to show his development but, your characters are constantly getting rewarded, and it definitely should not be a way to introduce a character to us.  But most importantly it is a violation of show, don't tell.</p><p>Also, I feel I wasn't that clear on what I meant by the importance of Pokemon. I meant that a person's pokemon should be a reflection be of the character, as a character's Pokemon don't only count as a their pet, it's also their 'power', their hobby, their goal, the only constant thing they have to interact with throughout their journey. Thus I feel they should be more important than just facts about the character, to be listed off. I feel that they should be tied to the character, like their hairstyle or the way they wear their clothing. They should be of emotional importance. Which character would choose which Pokemon, what kind of character would choose to use certain types of Pokemons, all of these signal us in to the character of the.... well, character. Thus, when they're just seemingly randomly chosen for each character, rather than customized, it feels like a bit of a let down.<br>Also, with the flow of the story. It feels like you go too easy on the characters. Most of the time they're in a group, so they have a net of safety which makes it feel less like a harsh journey into the wildernesses, and more like a group expedition. This isn't helped by them planning their encounters, giving them an additional safety net. Character weakness is story strength, and I feel  like a knowledge of shadow archetypes would help you immensely. Furthermore, the characters are rewarded too much, they haven't gotten past the third gym and they're already known throughout their region. Character rewarding is not as compelling as character punishment to test the character.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Nothing you're saying here is incorrect, the only problem is that I'm intending this to be a somewhat realistic story, and that realism makes itself known in a number of ways in the differences between a trainer's journey here and in other stories. One of those ways is that people don't actually have the luxury to build a team that reflects their character. This is not a game, to them. The team they use to journey in the wilds is not a fashion statement. They're catching and training pokemon in part to accomplish their lifelong ambition, and also in part to *survive.*</p><p>Now, when a trainer has been on their journey for years, or is already an established presence, that's a different situation. I'm pretty sure Blue has already referenced the "ideal team" that he has in mind at some point, though without all the particulars. Once a trainer is a veteran, *then* they can pick and choose from all the pokemon they've ever had the opportunity to catch and specifically train up and organize their team with things like personal preference and preferred style in mind. After your original review, I actually went back and edited the chapter a bit, and one of the lines I added is that Glen actually has enough pokemon that his preference for slower, bulkier pokemon is showing through. But he still compromises that to adapt to the situation they're in.</p><p>That means that, yes, most trainers are often using a seemingly random set of pokemon.  A few favorites will stay consistent, but past that, you're going to see a lot of common/generic/boring pokemon showing up more often than the popular ones, and you're going to see a mishmash that's more about ensuring a well-rounded team than  fitting any specific theme. If you've ever played a Nuzlocke playthrough, I'm basically picturing teams like those often have as what most trainers in this world use for most of their journeys.</p><p>Now, none of this excuses violations of "show, don't tell," and none of it excuses weak characterization. But I hope that explains why your expectation for the story may not match my vision of what a realistic pokemon world looks like, compared to many other fanfiction out there.</p><p>As for the characters being in too much safety or being rewarded too much, I can only say that  the story's not done yet :) If it's not exciting enough because you'd rather they be put in more danger and struggle against more adversity more often, I can understand that, but I also don't want to shuttle them from one near-death experience to another every time something happens. Again, trying for a realistic story means that starts to strain credulity at a certain point, and I'd rather reserve the really dangerous situations for ones like, well, this chapter, rather than artificially create tension at, say, the pineco capture, when instead they could use their group efforts and careful planning to demonstrate what intelligent trainers can do. Does that make sense?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>"That's not what I meant at all. It's easier if you think of danger as threat of something happening, while punishment is the thing actually happening. Punishment acts as an subconscious buff to the threats, it shows to the audience how far as a writer you are willing to go."</p><p>I don't see how this section contradicts what I said? You're treating them like two separate points, but rest assured, I understand that danger only matters if there are occasional consequences to it. You're saying there haven't been punishments of enough frequency or severity. I hear you. I'm just saying the story isn't done yet. If you're talking about where the story is now though, then again, you're talking about frequency, which translates to pacing. And I get that the pacing may be too slow, when there are such long stretches between any kind of risk of punishment occurring. I just don't want to add action beats for the sake of it, and so by extension, punishments have to take less obvious forms, like lost opportunities or hits to reputation or finances or relationships. I'll try to keep that in mind.</p><p>"Why don't they? I mean, if this is their lifelong ambition, they don't have to particularly hurry or make do with what they have. Hell, pokeballs are seemingly cheap as hell and our heroes rest for weeks or months at every city. If the Pokemon they choose are going to determine how good they're going to be at their careers as they train them for their whole lives and the Pokemon they depend on for their survival, what sense does it to just pick whatever random Pokemon you find on your first walk?"</p><p>The cost of pokeballs is not the bottleneck: the availability of desired pokemon and danger of facing them is. You ask what the hurry is, but it's less about time investment as natural progression of skills and experience. Trainer journeys are meant to help trainers improve their ability to travel, catch wild pokemon, train them, face dangers, etc. The alternative seems to be trainers spending money being ferried from one location to another specifically to hunt the pokemon they want the most, with minimal time spent on any pokemon they don't want, and just hoping their skills are good enough? I'm having trouble picturing why you think this would be a more efficient or beneficial, or what the benefit would be besides appeasing vanity.</p><p>"The world building clashes here a bit. See, you want to portray a world that's in constant disaster from Pokemon and that's okay. However you simultaneously portray a world full of comfort and advanced science. There's cars, newpapers, Poketwitter, internet articles and forums, foreign restuarants etc. This mixture makes both worlds unbelievable. Why is there so much talk over an internet opinion piece about mueseums when people die everyday to wildlife."</p><p>I think you're confusing your Outside View with the Inside View of those living in a fictional world. If you came from a planet where heart disease and cancer weren't things, reading about a country where thousands of people die every day to them might make you boggle that people in that country still care about random things like when the next superhero movie comes out or some celebrity cheating on their wife.</p><p>"Why isn't there roads or a metro or at least something resembling infrastructure between cities if we have internet? Hell, where's all the agriculture, it's like 'shiny civilization' followed immediately by "OHMYGODEVERYTHINGISABEAR""</p><p>Sorry if this comes off as a bit flippant, but these questions seem a bit off base. I've mentioned things like roads, metro, and farms in the story already. Travel infrastructure isn't used often by trainers on their journey, since it kind of defeats the purpose of roughing it in the first place, but they explicitly did use them on the way to visit Bill or pass by Saffron. Are you basically asking me to just mention cars and farms more as they travel?</p><p>"If like half of the youth( lowballing here) want to have an official league position, which in total consists of 12 for a region (E4, champ, Gym leader), then isn't that like half your youth population gunning for a spot on the national football team with no backups? I mean, even on an island like Kanto, that must result in thousands of teens without any other qualifications for other jobs."</p><p>Good question! The "no backups" part of this is where you're forgetting that the Rangers are a thing, or that private security like ACE exist, or that Gyms employ many more trainers than just their Leaders, or that police officers use pokemon, or that pokemon ranchers, breeders, researchers, and coordinators all need to be familiar with pokemon training and care.</p><p>Pokebattling is an essential part of being a trainer, because the world is dangerous and even ranchers have to be ready for random attacks. But it's not the only skill that people on their journeys acquire, and most trainers gunning for a spot in the League or at a Gym eventually realize their skills aren't good enough and follow a different passion.</p><p>"Also given how many people are gunning for their jobs and CAN take them if they're strong enough, how are the gym leaders holding onto their jobs for any amount of time? How are most of them even competent at anything other than fighting pokemon battles, if the only qualification to becoming one is to be good at poke battles?"</p><p>That's what comes from being the best of the best. We're talking about 8 positions in a region the size of several states. Not all the best battlers want to be leaders, but of those that do, if they're lacking in the other skills necessary, they're eventually going to get challenged by someone who's as good at battling *and* has the other skills, as shown by Sabrina taking the Saffron gym.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I'm not a biologist, but I think I can provide some biology technobabble that would explain the observed regenerative powers. Given how easily normal pokemon heal, I imagine that undifferentiated stem cells are standard issue, but some pokemon heal drastically more easily than others. In some cases, cancer might be avoided by outright magic; for example, Alakazam may have perfectly reliable DNA replication or may simply destroy any tumours that develop.</p><p>One possible not-obviously-magical solution is to use circular chromosomes, which have a *much* simpler replication process and don't contain telomeres. I'm going to discard this possibility on the grounds that almost all eukaryotic chromosomes are linear and almost all prokaryotic chromosomes are circular, which strongly suggests that there's a good reason for complex lifeforms to have linear chromosomes. (Biology Stack Exchange has some stuff about why this might be the case, but I couldn't find a standard answer with a few minutes of searching.)</p><p>The other possibility that comes to mind is having back-up DNA in specialised germ cells and a process for discarding and replacing chunks of the body. (Loss of these back-up cells, which cannot regenerate, would lead to regeneration causing either atrophy or cancer.) The somatic cells that can replicate rapidly (causing tissue regeneration) have telomeres of reasonable lengths. When an area of the body is damaged, the surviving cells (and any undifferentiated stem cells brought in from elsewhere) rapidly divide, restoring the tissue but burning through their telomeres.</p><p>The cancer problem is avoided by "restoring the DNA from back-up". The specialised germ cells replicate very infrequently and have very strict proofreading and error-checking mechanisms. When part of the body is forced to regenerate, the DNA in the back-up cells only divides once, but multiple copies are made (by some unspecified process that probably involves RNA polymerase and a miracle). These copied daughter chromosomes are only slightly shorter than the mother chromosomes from the back-up germ cells.</p><p>They could be used to make pluripotent stem cells that could then be transported through the body and used to grow new somatic cells at the damaged location, while the regenerated cells undergo apoptosis. Essentially, the regenerated tissue is replaced with cloned tissue that still has robust telomeres. You could also use another miracle to have some sort of virus-like cell transfer the copied DNA directly to the regenerated cells, replacing their nuclear DNA (but probably not their mitochondrial DNA) with the more trusted version. Instead of being replaced by cloned tissue, the regenerated tissue would be given new DNA with robust telomeres. (This would be harder to pull off, but would make more sense given that tissue regeneration happens so incredibly fast in some pokemon - without a mechanism like this, it would make more sense to scab and then regenerate slowly.)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for the breakdown!  The idea of specialized germ cells or magic virus-like cells going around in the body ensuring that regenerated cells are error-checked and have the proper DNA is appealing, since if they're biochemically replicable enough, that could just be what potions do: massively speed up their growth, or just spray millions of new ones onto a location, whereby they acquire the DNA of their host and get to work.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This seems like a solvable problem. Make a special design of pokeball that is very distinctive and clearly labelled, then carry it on your person. Personalise it so that it will only work on one specific person - the easy way to do it would be to reshape the ball into a bracelet or choker or something like that, and have it only work if it hasn't been taken off since it was last activated (using a standalone device that can analyse a blood sample, so that it only works on someone with the right DNA).</p><p>Include a wearable monitoring device that will activate the "ball" if the wearer's life signs are failing (and let the wearer choose how much risk to take for heart rate, breathing, brain activity and so on), and will also send out an alert saying where and when the device activated. Then sell safety bracelets and insurance to cover the costs of retrieval and storage (and maybe legal cover, too, to put the fear of lawyers into anyone who interferes).</p><p>Yes, you could hack these to murder people (much like hacking a pacemaker), but a pokedex can analyse the contents of a ball and it will look pretty damn fishy if there's no obvious cause of death. And the safety precautions would make it no more dangerous to the general public than an ordinary pokeball that can be hacked to capture a human, and much less dangerous than a pokeball that contains a pokemon trained to kill humans.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I suspect that Aiko is going to end up with a Sylveon. (If so, and if she's very lucky, she'll get a Pixilate Sylveon and it will be able to blast stuff with STAB Hyper Voice.)</p><p>Training an Eevee for battle when you aren't sure which way it will evolve is tricky, but there are some reliable points.</p><p>First, they all have one excellent base stat (130), one very good one (110), one decent one (95) and three cruddy ones (two 65s and a 60). This means that each one has only a couple of viable competitive roles. In particular, only Flareon and Leafeon have non-cruddy Atk, so the Eeveelutions almost do damage via SpA or Toxic (or Foul Play for some Umbreon, since it uses the foe's Atk stat). So Aiko should be pretty safe training her Eevee to use special attacks (notably Swift and, if she's lucky enough to get it as an egg move, Stored Power).</p><p>Second, most of the Eeveelutions are slow: only Leafeon, Espeon and Jolteon have Spe &gt; 65. This is a pretty crippling flaw for a competitive pokemon, since it makes sweeping difficult and revenge kills easy, particularly since only Vaporeon, Glaceon and Sylveon have two good defensive stats and a good offensive stat. This severely limits their offensive potential: some can take the offensive, but other pokemon do the job better. Only Jolteon is really meant for sweeping.</p><p>Third, they all have access to Wish and Heal Bell (via Eevee), making them all capable of acting as clerics. Healing injuries and status conditions without medicine will be very useful on a journey, particularly given that Heal Bell cures the whole team at once.</p><p>Fourth, they all get Protect, Substitute, Toxic, Curse, Work Up, Double Team and Baton Pass (via Eevee), and most get an extra boosting move (Agility for Jolteon, Calm Mind for Espeon and Sylveon, Acid Armour for Vaporeon, Barrier for Glaceon and Swords Dance for Leafeon). This makes them superb support pokemon. Most can't sweep, but they can set up sweeps for other pokemon, and they can defend the team with Double Team, Substitute, Protect and Baton Pass (which I presume swaps the locations of two pokemon, allowing the Eeveelutions to swap places with team-mates and tank hits with Protect).</p><p>This should make it much easier to train Eevee, since all the Eeveelutions can make effective use of the same core of moves. Wish, Heal Bell, Substitute, Protect, Double Team, Baton Pass, Toxic, Swift (for perfectly accurate support fire) and a STAB attack move should make a very respectable addition to the team, no matter how Eevee evolves.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This seems like a pretty easy problem to resolve. Sabrina doesn't have to repay Red immediately. They should be able to agree a reasonably fair exchange, so that Sabrina can try to learn Red's copying trick immediately (or as soon as he works out how to teach it) and Red can receive his reward when he's skilled enough to make proper use of her lessons (or if he discovers some crippling problem that he needs her help to cure).</p><p>I'm surprised that Sabrina isn't more eager to learn this trick or have Red demonstrate it to an anonymous stranger (i.e. Mazda) ASAP. That suggests that Mazda has already escaped. The appearance of the Cerulean Cave suggests that he has done so, but there's been no mention of a Tier 1 incident on Cinnabar Island, nor any other sign that Mazda is loose.</p><p>I'm also somewhat confused about why Mazda doesn't seem to have spent more time learning medicine, particularly genetics, and riding in the minds of pokemon that can heal themselves. One attempt to learn Recover from a single Alakazam seems like far too little effort.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>'“Yep.” Ryback starts to lead them back down the ridge. “Life was all microbial back then, and that’s where it all began, for us. Prokaryotes to eukaryotes, we’re all branches from the same roots. If I recall correctly, some new research was demonstrating how we can find bacterial DNA in a lot of the human genome. Amazing, isn’t it?”</p><p>“It certainly is,” Leaf says as she scribbles, while Blue grunts noncommittally and Red nods, lost in thought. He’s considering the implications of all the current life forms on the planet coming from bacteria. Do new species of pokemon that get discovered still have the same markers in their genome? If not, what would that imply? The abiogenesis theory?'</p><p>I feel that Red has been missing the wood for the trees. Why are humans the *only* macroscopic species that don't generally have superpowers? Either humans have a different evolutionary history from pokemon (which suggests that pokemon were created with Sufficiently Advanced Technology and replaced native lifeforms, or else that human civilisation was once capable of interstellar travel), or else humans are a kind of pokemon.</p><p>It would be very odd for humans to lose superpowers in becoming sapient, partly because hominids couldn't have survived against pokemon without having something better than stone tools and tactics, partly because being psychic is a tremendous advantage for a social primate and a trainer, and partly because energy budgets don't seem to matter much to pokemon.</p><p>Regarding technology, the oldest Oldowan tools are about 2.5 million years old, and tool use probably goes back significantly further than that. Homo sapiens sapiens is about 200,000 years old. But domestication of animals seems to be at most 15,000 years old, and taming of wild animals seems unlikely to be too much older than that. How would weak, sapient hominids survive long enough to tame pokemon?</p><p>Regarding psychic trainers, some modern humans are capable of pokemon-like feats. In particular, some humans can read and manipulate the minds of pokemon and other humans. That's an incredible advantage for a member of a species with complex social behaviour - I'm convinced that the Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis is correct, i.e. that  an intelligence arms race to win social games is the primary reason for human intelligence - and an incredible advantage for a hominid that could be killed by the local equivalent of a pigeon or a rabbit. Any similar advantage seems similarly unlikely to atrophy - for example, fighting-type humans (Aura users) seem to also have huge social and physical advantages, without any apparent loss of intelligence.</p><p>Regarding energy budgets, pokemon laugh at the idea. One Flamethrower, Earthquake or Hyper Beam must involve far more energy than could reasonably be gained from food (unless, perhaps, the primary producers - ordinary non-sentient plants, phytoplankton, chemoautotrophs and so on - are also able to draw on the magical energy source that powers pokemon). Moreover, such an attack must involve at least as much energy as is used to support a human brain. That means that there should be no ATP shortage for supporting larger brains - the marginal cost of a bigger brain is much lower than IRL, so the same marginal benefit should lead to a higher-IQ equilibrium. So we should expect the smartest animals (humans) to be much smarter than real-world humans and pokemon in general to be smarter than real-world life-forms in similar ecological niches.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>These are all good points! It's worth noting though that there are a number of normal pokemon that don't, to all appearances, have "powers." Like raticate or ursaring, where all their attacks are basically just physical uses of their natural weapons. There aren't really any overt signs that such pokemon have something "extra" to them that humans don't.</p><p>And yeah, energy budgets are screwy in Pokemon. But since the humans don't really have a baseline for what's abnormal, things like that are just "the way reality is" to them</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Even if pokeball tech can be reshaped into a choker or bracelet or something (which there's no reason to think it can, certainly nothing like that has ever shown up in the games, and I can't recall any in the anime), overcoming the technological challenges would still leave the social and legal ones. People may be allowed to choose to go into a pokeball of their own volition, but it's still illegal to make one specifically for that purpose.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I'm not sure, but I think that Blue's first command was Bulldoze. I think he saw that the graveller was stronger than he'd expected, predicted that he'd need to poison it in order to avoid losing to Seismic Toss, and managed that by having Rive use Poison Jab instead of Horn Attack. Horn Attack should be Atoh, not Atah, and I think Blue has keyed Poison Jab to Atah instead of Ajop so that he can use it secretly.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Baton Pass has never been used in the anime, but it appears in the Mystery Dungeon games and does swap the locations of two allied pokemon (and passes stat boosts). It's pretty much a Naruto-style replacement jutsu. It has also appeared in the manga, being used with or without location switches to pass on stat boosts.</p><p>Substitute has been used in the anime and in the manga, and creates a Naruto-style shadow clone capable of independent action rather than an inanimate, generic doll. (Double Team creates many copies that disappear as soon as they're hit, while a Substitute can survive hits and do things.)</p><p>As for knowing stat breakdowns, no, they clearly don't have anything like the precision or accuracy we do. But they should be able to tell that Leafeon and Flareon both hit really hard in melee combat, unlike any other Eeveelutions, and that all the Eeveelutions but Umbreon and Leafeon hit hard with special moves. The difference between 65 and 110 is pretty darn noticeable: it would be like confusing a Mareep (SpA 65) and an Ampharos (SpA 115), or a Cyndaquil (SpA 60) and a Typhlosion (SpA 109). There's no way they could miss that almost all the Eeveelutions are much better special attackers than physical attackers.</p><p>Similarly, it should be obvious from casual observation that most Eeveelutions are really slow (by competitive standards) - Aiko's Eevee (Spe 55) should be somewhat faster than her Krabby (50), but a bit slower than Maturin (58). Charmander and Sandslash both have a base speed of 65, so they're about as fast as most Eeveelutions. There's an unmissable gap between that and Leafeon's 95 (about as fast as Aiko's Raticate at 97), let alone Espeon's 110 (as fast as Gengar, Dodrio or Raichu, and faster than Rapidash and Pidgeot) or Jolteon's 130 (*blindingly* fast, beating Talonflame and Weavile, and only losing to three non-mega non-legendaries).</p><p>Again similarly, it should be common knowledge that the Eeveelutions generally tank special hits better than physical ones: only Leafeon has SpD &lt; 95, but barring Leafeon, Glaceon and Umbreon (130, 110, 110), every Eeveelution has Def &lt; 66. Using neutral STABs from OU sweepers, Psychic from Alakazam will do ~40% to uninvested Sylveon but ~82% to uninvested Leafeon; Earthquake from Garchomp will do ~100% to uninvested Sylveon, but only ~34% to univested Leafeon (i.e. ~68% without resistance). The difference in resilience would be obvious to a child watching matches on TV, let alone a battle trainer who has done some basic research.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You're right that there are general ideas of how fast or slow or strong or tough pokemon are by observation, but a lot of the breakdowns don't actually translate the way they do in the game. For example "special attacks" in my world are not the same as "special attacks" in the pokemon games, since a lot of the nuance comes from whether it's a mental attack vs a physical attack, or whether it's a close combat attack or a ranged attack, and so on.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Wouldn't exposure to Pressure gradually build a minor resistance to it? Maybe <br>You seem to be treating it like poison ivy, where a persons reaction to it increases with each exposure?<br>As it is currently understood by the characters, Pressure is the equivalent of being forced to feel mental stress.<br>In the real world our brain responds to stress in two main paths*, Growth and Withdrawal.<br>The below is highly generalized, as I don't have time for an exhaustive study with my current job.</p><p>Growth:<br>Situation: Person is presented with an external or internal problem.<br>Response: Person uses current skills if sufficient, or gains new skills. To overcome the problem.<br>Results:<br>Successful: The problem is mitigated and/or removed. The person has gained a better chance of facing a future problem and stress decreases. (increased Pressure resistance in this case.)</p><p>Delayed Successful: At first the problem is not removed by the response, the person is somewhat discouraged but continues to try and eventually succeeds, often with an even greater sense of accomplishment or growth than the first example. (Increased ability to handle similar future problem)</p><p>Failure: The problem is not removed, the person may continue with similar results for a time, but eventually the growing discouragement convinces them that they cannot beat the problem and instead decide to withdrawal from it. Stress grows. (Even more gunshy or susceptible to the Pressure.)</p><p>Seeking help: An option for any of these, but a more complicated one that I won't explore for now.</p><p>Withdrawal:<br>Situation: Person is presented with an external or internal problem.<br>Response: Person ignores, or retreats from the problem, insulating themselves as best they can from the thing they believe they cannot do or face by focusing on the things they are comfortable or confident in accomplishing. Alternatively, this means giving themselves time to collect themselves before attempting Growth (Example of this being good at least temporarily is Red partitioning his mind against grief, allowing him to function well, but preventing his Physic Growth.)<br>Result<br>Successful: Focusing on that which they can accomplish maintains there mental health and productively at a sub-optimal but "good-enough" level to simply outlast, or circumnavigate it by changing something else to make it no longer a problem. Often referred to as "focusing on your strengths rather than weaknesses". Stress reduced or even removed. (may not affect Pressure resistance, but they probably stopped attacking things with Pressure).</p><p>Delayed Successful: The problem doesn't let up. Stress increases. They double down and withdrawal more (likely to affect other things and maybe cause more problems), but they do eventually succeed in ignoring or outrunning that particular problem. Affects vary, but are probably bad in the long term.</p><p>Failure (realized): It doesn't work. After a variable amount of time the character realizes this and resoles the face the problem and attempt Growth.</p><p>Total failure: Life long depression, suicide, or similiar. Can still be saved by outside help. (Geez, this got darker than I intended.)</p><p>Summary: Conditioning makes us versatile humans stronger at least as often as it wears us down, and it's hard to imagine that everyone take the Withdrawal route with a negative result. Why was Pressure treated as a blanket "succeed the first time or it's more impossible the next" ?</p><p>*(feel free to debate that assumption, but i kept it fairly general).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Huh. I find that surprising, since I've found reading his work has had that effect on my own life a number of times. I don't think I'm smarter than Daniel Kahneman, so maybe he's just being modest or holding himself to some impossibly high standard of what it means to "overcome biases." Like I don't think it's possible to totally eliminate biases, but it's certainly possible to identify and mitigate their effects. If it weren't, no one would be capable of changing their mind about any major political issue... granted it's a rare occurrence, but it does happen!</p>]]></message>

There's no hints or reason to believe that her using that power should be possible, and so it comes off as a deux ex machina, breaking Sanderson's first law, "An author's ability to solve conflict with magic should be proportional to how well the reader understands said magic."</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Wouldn't exposure to Pressure gradually build a minor resistance to it? Maybe <br>You seem to be treating it like poison ivy, where a persons reaction to it increases with each exposure?<br>As it is currently understood by the characters, Pressure is the equivalent of being forced to feel mental stress.<br>In the real world our brain responds to stress in two main paths*, Growth and Withdrawal.<br>The below is highly generalized, as I don't have time for an exhaustive study with my current job.</p><p>Growth:<br>Situation: Person is presented with an external or internal problem.<br>Response: Person uses current skills if sufficient, or gains new skills. To overcome the problem.<br>Results:<br>Successful: The problem is mitigated and/or removed. The person has gained a better chance of facing a future problem and stress decreases. (increased Pressure resistance in this case.)</p><p>Delayed Successful: At first the problem is not removed by the response, the person is somewhat discouraged but continues to try and eventually succeeds, often with an even greater sense of accomplishment or growth than the first example. (Increased ability to handle similar future problem)</p><p>Failure: The problem is not removed, the person may continue with similar results for a time, but eventually the growing discouragement convinces them that they cannot beat the problem and instead decide to withdrawal from it. Stress grows. (Even more gunshy or susceptible to the Pressure.)</p><p>Seeking help: An option for any of these, but a more complicated one that I won't explore for now.</p><p>Withdrawal:<br>Situation: Person is presented with an external or internal problem.<br>Response: Person ignores, or retreats from the problem, insulating themselves as best they can from the thing they believe they cannot do or face by focusing on the things they are comfortable or confident in accomplishing. Alternatively, this means giving themselves time to collect themselves before attempting Growth (Example of this being good at least temporarily is Red partitioning his mind against grief, allowing him to function well, but preventing his Physic Growth.)<br>Result<br>Successful: Focusing on that which they can accomplish maintains there mental health and productively at a sub-optimal but "good-enough" level to simply outlast, or circumnavigate it by changing something else to make it no longer a problem. Often referred to as "focusing on your strengths rather than weaknesses". Stress reduced or even removed. (may not affect Pressure resistance, but they probably stopped attacking things with Pressure).</p><p>Delayed Successful: The problem doesn't let up. Stress increases. They double down and withdrawal more (likely to affect other things and maybe cause more problems), but they do eventually succeed in ignoring or outrunning that particular problem. Affects vary, but are probably bad in the long term.</p><p>Failure (realized): It doesn't work. After a variable amount of time the character realizes this and resoles the face the problem and attempt Growth.</p><p>Total failure: Life long depression, suicide, or similiar. Can still be saved by outside help. (Geez, this got darker than I intended.)</p><p>Summary: Conditioning makes us versatile humans stronger at least as often as it wears us down, and it's hard to imagine that everyone take the Withdrawal route with a negative result. Why was Pressure treated as a blanket "succeed the first time or it's more impossible the next" ?</p><p>*(feel free to debate that assumption, but i kept it fairly general).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The basic idea of mental attacks in my pokemon world is that they are, by and large, outside forces that inflict those emotional states or sensory confusion onto the person. So they are much harder to deal with than "normal," self-generated fear or depression or anxiety or distraction. I imagine this to be a trauma that gets worse because it is so effectively outside your control or ability to combat. The mental grooves worn into your mind are molded by the experiences, making you more receptive to the stimulation of the psychic or ghost or other effects.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I'll take that much.</p><p>What I do expect now though is that a method, technique, or training against mental attacks does exist, and isn't limited to psychic humans. Even if it's so complex that it is all but unknown and/or requires years to learn, or so simple (note: simple, not easy) as to be accomplished by simultaneously focusing on the task you are trying to accomplish, while blocking the mental attack with an unyieldingly stubborn personal rhyme or unending song.</p><p>Point is mental attacks shouldn't be the ultimate, someone, something, or some method should be able to stop it, even if it's something the characters decide costs more than just running the risk.<br>Heck, you could even have a pokemon move or ability serve as a countering aura to the pressure like uproar does to sleep attacks. Getting or training said pokemon would, of course, cost time and energy that must be taken from other endeavors, but make sure you show it's possible.</p><p>Hope I came across well. I've loved what you've done so far.</p><p>Oh, and does Aiko have any of the armor mesh clothing like Red was mentioned to have? I couldn't help but think of that when she was attacked.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey Daystar Eld, you mentioned that you would love to see a Pokemon type of fiction that allowed for trainers and Pokemon to be equal. I want to let you know that the anime Monster Rancher does exactly this. They even have episodes that are dedicated to a monster revolt from being treated sadistically as slaves. What's more, the main character trainer, Genki, is treated like a monster himself with his own moves and combos that he performs with the other monsters. Essentially, Genki is in charge, because he knows more about the monsters and their special moves then the monsters themselves plus he grows to be a fair leader earning the respect of even the Rogue characters that appear on his team. I think you will like this anime if you have a chance to track it down and watch at least the first season. For a kids show it's pretty heavy with drama that most [priviledged] kids never have to deal with.</p><p>Thanks for such a great podcast series. I have been interested in writing some stories that are of the rationalist fiction genre and having spent my education learning science it's great to know that a lot of the process of writing can be summarized by individuals like yourselves to help me get started.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Sorry, but this chapter finally shattered my SoD regarding the age of the main characters. The only way to reconcile it was by deciding that in my headcanon the Pokemon world needs 450 days to cycle around their sun (~25% longer than our real Earth).<br>Because even if you take into account how a harsh world makes them more mature and responsible kids and how the protagonists are all prodigies raised by prodigies, there's no way an 11-12 year old has a crush and a plan on how to deal with it in this way.<br>Look how Red's otherworldly cousin Harry dealt with a good friend having a crush on him around the same age.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Well, the actual function of Trick Room doesn't actually make pokemon faster or slower: their Speed stats don't rise or lower. It just reverses priority order, so that pokemon who have lower speed will act ahead of those with faster speed. So the way I'm envisioning it, the psychic pokemon puts out constant AoE projection that messes with motor function and coordination in a way that disadvantages faster pokemon.</p><p>As for the pokemon switching out, yeah, that's one thing that would not remain the same, but that makes more sense to me anyway, since only mythical psychic pokemon can actually affect the fabric of reality the way you're describing. My version of Gravity is just a telekinetic force that pulls things down, the idea that some pokemon can actually increase gravity on a certain spot of land  doesn't even make sense, gravity isn't the attraction to the grass or dirt, it's the mass of the planet itself. If you increase the mass of a spot of the earth enough to increase its gravity that noticeably it would draw *everything* around it inward, not just a convenient vertical column. It would also affect more than just flying or levitating pokemon, it would slow down all pokemon and make projectiles not work and a bunch of other things the game version doesn't take into account.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I agree with all your points.</p><p>My main reason for disliking prophecies is that they are often used to create a character who is The Chosen One. The one and only person who was born special and uniquely gifted, and only this one character now can save the world.</p><p>I don’t like the real-life implications of writers creating characters who have randomly won the genetic lottery. I like to believe that all humans are born equal. Sure, some are lucky to have talents for art or athletics or math or whatever, but I still don’t see one child as superior or more special than all others. More importantly, in human societies it should be one’s actions and not circumstances of birth that make a person respected and admired. After all, the antique notion of royal blood has been long debunked by scientific research about population genetics.</p><p>And then there are protagonists who are The Chosen Ones. Declared special even before their birth. Apparently due to having better genes that they inherited from their supposedly superior parents. Never mind that in the real world the false idea of some humans being born superior to others lead to the horrors of eugenics and discrimination of entire populations.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I think there used to be a cultural significance, an ugly one. Humans used to believe that royal blood existed. There used to be such a thing as a rightful heir to the throne who was destined to lead a nation towards prosperity (and nobody else without the royal blood couldn’t do the same job for some weird reasons). There was also a belief that entire races were genetically inferior and thus destined to be slaves. When writers create fictional worlds, those reflect the values and beliefs of the society.</p><p>I would be OK with a writer creating a fictional race of magic users where some individuals have stronger magical abilities than others (and this trait would be genetically inherited). But I’d still want some justifications and limitations. A single individual who is vastly stronger than the rest of the population wouldn’t make sense. I would only accept as reasonable that some individuals are only somewhat stronger than others. Moreover, probably I would also want some reasons that prevent mixing of the genes. For example, a cultural norm that bans strong magic users from having sex with weak magic users. Or something like that. Because otherwise evolution would take its course (stronger magic users leaving more surviving offspring) and the beneficial genes would just spread through the entire population.</p><p>But a single chosen one among a human-like population makes little sense. The protagonist is destined to be the hero, because he is the only one possessing royal blood that allows him to wield the magical supersword? And on top of that, he was also born smarter and stronger than everybody else. How can a writer justify this one? After all, basic understanding of population genetics would indicate that everybody is the kingdom has the same “royal blood.”</p><p>By the way, I can think of a plot where I’d be OK with prophecies. One of the protagonists is a con artist, a charlatan who fakes being a prophet in order to earn some money and fame. He makes a large number of vague statements. On one day, he accidentally hits the jackpot when one of his many prophecies comes true due to a random chance. The fake prophet becomes famous. If he’s a smart person, he can now start making other prophecies in order to influence politics/improve his personal social standing/settle private resentments, etc. People who believe in the prophet’s power will try to fulfill the fake prophecies. Other characters will try to prevent them from coming true. Now we are dealing with political intrigues and self-fulfilling prophecies. In this scenario prophecies would be a plot device, but it could be possible to make it fun and entertaining. Personally, I’d make the prophet a snarky and sarcastic guile hero who uses wit for achieving his goals. After all, the main benefit of using a fake prophecy for a story is that readers cannot know whether it will or won’t come true, hence no spoilers.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>There are various factors that influence whether some experience will be traumatic for a person.</p><p>Here's one example from my own life. Back when I was a small child, I somewhere heard that spanking children <br>is illegal in my country. That meant I was allowed to fight back. And I sure did. I <br>“won” several fistfights against adults. It usually went like this: Some<br> adult wants to discipline me and hits me. I hit back. We exchange a <br>couple of punches. I absolutely refuse to give up—the more they hit me, <br>the more desperately I fight back, totally ignoring the pain from any <br>hits they managed to land on me. The adult realizes that their attempt <br>to discipline me isn’t working—unless they break all my limbs, I won’t <br>give up. At that point the adult gives up. I have “won” the fight. My <br>ego skyrocketed. In my childish naivety, I believed that I must be <br>absolutely amazing if I won a fistfight against an adult (it took me a <br>while to realize that I wasn’t “winning” these fights, adults simply <br>decided to stop). I wasn’t hurt or traumatized, I was absolutely happy. <br>And did I mention my ego skyrocketed after each failed attempt to <br>discipline me? Thus, as a child, through sheer stubbornness, I converted<br> what ought to have been a traumatizing experience into a moment of <br>triumph. Not that there were many such occasions. My mother attempted to<br> spank me exactly once. The end result was her getting bruises. She didn’t try it for the second time. Childhood spanking wasn't traumatizing for me only because of my unique circumstances ("stubborn" just happened to be one of my personality traits).</p><p>How people react to unpleasant events depends on numerous factors that are out of our control (for instance, in my example I never got to choose my personality traits, I just happened to be the way I was). This is why nobody should ever blame the victim for being too sensitive. You experienced a similar potentially traumatic event and coped with it very well? Congratulations, you got lucky. But you have no right to criticize other people who have experienced a similar event and failed to cope with it equally well, because, after all, other people's unique circumstances can be entirely different than your own.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Why were the rebel ships running out of fuel? They're moving through a vacuum, so they don't need constant usage of fuel to go in a straight line! <br>Speaking of which, until I get a better explanation of hyperspace other than 'really fast,' I would like to know how they decelerate from hyperspace. I can (almost) deal with the inertia problems since they're generating artificial gravity anyway, but there has to be engines in the front of the ship just to get back to normal speed.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Heh, didn't even think of that. Maybe they had to keep tapping the thrusters  to stay head of the Order, who kept speeding up too?</p><p>As for hyperspace, I just assumed that they travel through some extra dimensional space (hence the name) that they then just drop out of at a different point. The idea of *actually just flying through space really fast* has a ton of other problems.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Even if there is some inter-dimension thing going on, Solo showed that it also allows for ships to go much faster than usual, in which case there is no reason to decelerate in a vacuum. You should be able to create a process using a specific amount of coaxium/hyperfuel to travel at larger fractions of light speed than previously. It's not quite as annoying as the whole midichlorian thing, but I'm still bothered by it.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>As a note, in the games there is no (longer) a counter to Pressure. Not even Mold Breaker. Though having Pressure give permanent effects on people (and Pokemon?) is disappointing.</p><p>So what happens if someone owns a Pressure Pokemon? Does the ability still affect the owner? Does it affect other Pressure Pokemon? Are there really zero Absol and Weavile available for testing? Perhaps studying them would lead to a discovery of a cure, or maybe just a way to counter or negate it.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>If I remember, it was discovered that certain Pokémon produced a special "flying" particle spurred by Red's reservations about the typing system. Production of these flying particles became a new way of classifying Flying types, and it was said that Gyarados was thought to not be Flying before in this universe. There is special emphasis on the typing system and its place in a real world setting, however I don't think that it will have any particular significance to the story's progression</p>]]></message>

Mandatory military service (in this case trainer service I guess?) complete with some kind of basic training for using pokemon to help in these sorts of situations, how to train pokemon well, a lot of the training Vermillion gym already does... That way, everyone in the region should have some pokemon on them at all times and some basic knowledge about how to use them. They'll remember that training for the rest of their lives, and then there'd be fewer people who are in need of rescuing.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>MY DUDE. I'm on my 2nd read-through of this fabulous body of work you've crafted, and I gotta stop and talk about this poem.</p><p>When we do world-building exercises, we often pick specific parts of worlds to flush out. Are there fire-breathing dragons in every castle? Who mines all the steel the dwarves forge with? Is there a black market for lightsabers or similar devices? People often  get so wrapped up in one part of the world they forget about the rest. I know your focus is on rationality, and tbh that's why I love reading this so much. I also know you've done extensive work on the poke-world's technology, and I can't explain how much I appreciate that. But writing a poem that sees popular use at funerals? that's some next level shit my man!</p><p>There is a but here, in case you didn't feel that coming... it doesn't feel to me particularly Japanese. I know it's spoken by Leaf, a Unovan (American-Decendant), which the poetic style fits perfectly. I also know that Tohjo (perhaps also Sinno and Hoenn?) speak Unovan, which leads us to believe theirs some degree of globalization going on (I've often wondered how many regions aren't discovered, how far the Unovan military must have travelled to have fought any other region).</p><p>I guess my point is that I'd like a Haiku or Waka style poem representing the more traditional Kantoan values to be what Red's used to, as opposed to a single line at the bottom that's different.</p><p>Hyper-specific world-building poetry finished, you've gotta know; yours is some of the best writing I've ever enjoyed. Reading this has changed my life. I've convinced no one to read the story, but my friends sure wish I'd shut up about it. I'm gonna go put my money where my mouth is and find you on patreon!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey, thanks for the feedback! The language they're all speaking is actually "unown," which is basically how I decided to make the unown pokemon alphabet makes sense; they're the glyphs used for the universal language :) You're definitely right that there should be a wider variety of older rites used that are more specific to regional cultures, however, and maybe I'll explore that some more in the future.</p><p>Thanks for your patronage, and I'm glad the story has been so meaningful for you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>By now I’m starting to dislike Blue as a character. During the first chapters Blue seemed fun. Sure, he was overconfident and ignored the obvious fact that it was foolish to run into a Tier 3 threat with just his starter and a pidgey. Nonetheless, he was still fun to read about. And I also expected some character growth from him, I expected him to wise up, learn his limits, and realize that being suicidal is neither smart nor courageous.</p><p>Yet by now I’m starting to dislike Blue. Aiko quickly became my favorite character. I liked her more than all the main characters. Blue acts recklessly, he himself manages to always stay alive due to being a main character and having plot armor. Instead it’s his friends who end up dying due to pressure from Blue who forces other people to act in a suicidal manner in a futile attempt to be heroic. Blue is unfit to be a leader. A reckless character getting himself hurt wouldn’t be that annoying, but a reckless leader hurting his followers is annoying to read about.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It is unreal how well thought this is. With Red in Saffron, Blue is absolutely in a state of mind of wanting to avoid it and the gym at all costs for the moment, meaning he'll have to go to Celadon (as its the next closest to Vermilion) for his next gym challenge. Just the way that you manage to come up with these plot details for why Blue takes the same gym order as the games is simply genius. Kudos to you, sir.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This was an interesting chapter.</p><p>What happened to Vlad and Bretta is only superficially similar to what happened with Red and Aiko. In a gym battle stakes are low. Vlad didn’t get permanently hurt in any way, he didn’t even loose a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The only negative consequence is being forced to stay in a city for a bit longer until the rematch. The overwhelming majority of trainers don’t win all of their eight badges on the first try anyway. Sure, trainers ere emotionally invested in their gym battles and want to win them without rematches, but that’s all.</p><p>I can think of rational reasons why a trainer might choose to stay by their friend’s side in a gym battle. It can offer emotional support to a friend who would otherwise have to be alone while watching their pokemon get massacred. If the two teammates are also traveling companions, it makes sense to stick together, because both will have to stay in the city until<br>the rematch anyway.</p><p>I can easily imagine Red choosing to stay by his partner’s side in a gym battle. I can also imagine Vlad choosing to leave a teammate in a life and death situation. What somebody chooses to do in a gym battle where the stakes are much lower isn’t a reliable proxy for what they would choose to do when facing a certain death.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>By the way, I looked at “Pokemon Team Roster 2,” and there were some oddities. Didn’t Blue catch a Steelix? Wasn’t Zephyr supposed to know Brave Bird? I think I remember Eevee using Double Edge at some point. And Charmeleon used some fire-from-his-mouth attack while fighting the Magneton. And Leaf’s Venonat (Ruby) practiced using Sleep Powder while Leaf was researching her article on the renegade murder.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is an certainly interesting way to deal with betrayal from subordinates. I do wonder If Giovanni is saving these people, as in keeping them in the pokeballs to be revived later once death has been defeated and he is a hero to everyone.</p><p>On the one hand if he is serious about his "defeat death" plan he probably wouldn't want to kill his enemies if he doesn't have to. He also almost certainly already has a facility set up for his/his loyal supporters own pokeball retirement so the cost of keeping traitors us however much the electricity costs.</p><p>On the other hand it is still a cost, one that traitors might not be worthy of even under Giovanni's general anti death attitude. There's also the risk that if they are preserved until the damage can be undone that their story might turn society against Giovanni.</p>]]></message>

I mean it's noble of him but it comes out a bit out of nowhere (so I think at the moment).</p><p>And then as I finish the chapter, the realization hit me like a train. He's giving away abras to rangers not only to take on his grief by doing something his father would have been proud of, but also <i>to give rangers better chance of survival so their family won't have to live what he's been through</i>.</p><p>Damn, it's beautiful and sad and awesome.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Your definition of bigotry, "false beliefs about a specific demographic that knowingly disadvantage or cause harm to that demographic" is reasonable. What about beliefs that are <i>true</i> and have exactly the same effect? Are such beliefs, no less damaging than bigotry, acceptable to hold simply because they are "true" (i.e., because you hold them yourself)? What about beliefs with insufficient evidence either way? <br>I expect you see the problem, but to be explicit: should one believe so-called "hate facts," which may be defined as "<i>true </i>beliefs about a specific demographic that <s>knowingly</s> disadvantage or cause harm to that demographic"? Or must one deny their existence, and even the possibility of their existence?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I think it's worth recognizing a fact as true no matter the implications that some may draw from it. But I think it's very important for people to recognize those implications and become *excessively* careful not to believe false things. Like normally you might be willing to say you believe something after you have sufficient evidence to reach an 80% confidence in it, but mostly because if you're wrong it doesn't matter *that* much. However, if you know that a belief would cause people to be discriminated against and oppressed by others, I think the moral thing to do is require an incredibly high bar of confidence before being willing to claim that the thing is true.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Alright time to crash, heh and someone else stopped here. Is it just a good stopping point?</p><p>Not normally into rationalist fiction, and although the hallmarks are all over this they are more tolerable here. I'd call out pacing as the biggest problem.</p><p>Also one of the few things of what I could reasonably call i dunno "scientific fiction", that is that the protagonist is actually doing science, which is slow, and hard, and involves a lot of wasted time and you don't know if it's going to be a waste until you do it. Rather than just wizard braining up cheats for the system. <br>While Red still feels very "flat earth atheisty" in his assumptions being deeply rooted in our world, but that works here because we the reader know places he is wrong (like the psychic/ghost distinction he doesn't want to make.) which helps makes his exploration of them clear that work supports his methods but not his existing assumptions.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I started reading ch. 1 a few months ago and have just now caught up. I came to this story having read several of the most popular rationalist works, but I haven't spent much time in the Pokemon universe except for GO. As a result, I've probably missed some finer points of the research and world (re)building that you put into creating such a rational branch of the Pokemon world.</p><p>I'm currently enjoying this like I enjoyed HPMoR. I specifically like how realistic your protagonists feel. Sure, they're really smart, but they still make relatable mistakes and learn from each other and their adult mentors in a way that Harry was too perfect for. I wonder if many people who never got past Harry's attitude would find your characters more likable.</p><p>Another thing that really sets your story apart for me is that you've written so many characters to be understood. I can see what drives them and sympathize even when I disagree. This may be an aspect of rational fiction, but it also just seems like good writing.</p><p>I'm looking forward to seeing where you take this!</p>]]></message>

As a trans person, I am always happy whatever I see LGBTQIA+ characters in stories.</p><p>Speaking of Hoenn characters, I always imagined that Tate and Liza were identical twins with one of them being a trans person.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Beautiful story! Self harm is a really sensitive topic, but the way you incorporate it seems so authentic and avoids the cliches. I really felt the turmoil of the characters.</p><p>The world building in this short story was really tight too. It felt like there's a lot of depth to this world, but you only flesh it out where it's important to the story.I think that's a sign of a good writer. That was a great ending along the same lines-we get closure of the immediate issues but are left imagining where out will go from here. It's somehow optimistic but also realistic.</p><p>5/5!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Basically I'm using real-world geography as much as possible, while just overlaying the landmarks of the game world as much as makes sense :) This is because the game maps are inconsistent, and it's nearly impossible to get a sense of distance from the game maps, but really easy to see where they're "supposed" to be over the real world map.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>One thing that interests me is how the gym system manages to produce competent social leaders. It's been addressed before, but such a feudal system would seem to favor those who value battling above anything else, so much so that taking the time to start a sociopolitical movement may be detrimental to a trainer's career, assuming that the champion truly is the best and most dedicated trainer. If the champion were not the most dedicated/talented then surely that person could then become champion? Though perhaps they just don't want it.</p><p>I know it's been addressed with the story about Saffron gym and the strong but inept fighting type leader that Sabrina defeated, and in this chapter Erika's focus on social issues becomes a strength in that her more dedicated gym third can defend her title, but surely there must eventually be a barbaric champion who simply dedicates 100% of their time to battling and becomes champion just for the status, no?</p><p>What happens when the champion is some undefeatable opponent who doesn't care about the region, refuses to give up his title for the greater good, and pulls rank to do harm? Again, we assume that this is the most dedicated and talented trainer in the world so there is no latent professor oak or other to put them in their place. Such is the flaw of a feudal system.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In those cases I think what would tend to happen is that the responsibilities of being Champion would ultimately drive them away; like each of these positions needs to some degree a person who wants to spend their time working with/helping others. Someone who just wants the title can get it then give up the position.</p><p>But it is possible, and it's a risk of the system.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, that's fair. I imagine that if a champion were to neglect their responsibilities long enough, then some subset of the region's elites, gym leaders, trainers, citizens, government, etc would force them to resign. It's still interesting to think about though.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I fear I'll make a long comment for a absolutly minor detail. But I really stumbled when reading this sentence:<br>"Aiko looks at the three of them with some hesitation, but thinks it over as Red finally reaches out to grab some bread and spread cream cheese over it."</p><p>My first instinct was that it should say "spreads" instead of "spread" because Red reaches out to grab the bread (fine so far), but he does not reach out to spread the cheese. I didn't read the grab-bread-and-spread-cheese as a coupled statement.<br>But even if I had I would still prefer present tense because that would shift the focus from the intention to the actual activity of spreading the cheese. This way the sentence would feel like more time is passing and therefore support the next sentence which says that Aiko answers only after a couple of minutes.</p><p>I hope I don't bother you over nothing...</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I'm a fan of Pokemon: The Origin of Species and started reading the content on your website after you mentioned it in the most recent chapter you posted. I enjoy a lot of what I've read here, but this article made me uncomfortable, since the church I belong to seems mis-represented. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I'd like to offer some sources and insight that may explain or disprove stances you think we have.<br>Before you discount what I say as being biased because of my affiliation to the church or irrational because you don't believe in the Book of Mormon or religion in general, please hear me out. I recognize that I have biases, having been raised in the church, but I'll try to keep my biases out of this and I'll do my best to provide some official sources and reasonable explanations where relevant, and if you want, I can give additional sources and explanations since there's a lot that goes into it that I won't be able to think of off the top of my head here and now. There are definitely aspects of things that are more faith based than scientifically proven in my religion (though we do also believe in science). I realize and understand that you believe my religion to be false partly because of that. I'm not saying you have to agree with me, just please try to be open minded and see things from the perspective of someone who does believe it if you are going to read what I have to say, even if it isn't all proven scientifically.<br>First, homosexuality. I'll start by saying Card's stances on making it illegal make me uncomfortable since agency is very important to our religion, so I'm a bit uncomfortable with involving the law in morality matters (unless it's murder or stealing or something that hurts others). I'm not trying to defend what he's said or done, but rather my religion in the way it's portrayed. Anyway, the church has no issue with those who have homosexual attraction being members of the church, or even gay or lesbian couples attending (though some members might act like it) since we believe that we're all children of God and of equal value to him. The point where we believe it's a sin is when taken beyond feelings and into actual actions, and even then (assuming the commandment of not judging others is being followed), they may not be allowed to be members, but they shouldn't be treated as though they have less value than someone who's straight. I realize you probably still take issue with this, but I have an explanation as to why. This is primarily due to the focus and importance that we place on the traditional family structure. We believe that mothers and fathers have different roles in the family, and while the distinctions can be altered based on extenuating circumstances, the relationship between a husband and wife is sacred. Here is an article discussing some of the details as well as containing a specific document that has some clarification: <a href="https://www.thechurchnews.com/history-revisited/2020-09-23/family-proclamation-25th-anniversary-president-hinckley-marriage-gender-193319" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.thechurchnews.com/history-revisited/2020-09-23/family-proclamation-25th-anniversary-president-hinckley-marriage-gender-193319">https://www.thechurchnews.c...</a> (While this site is related to the church, it still explains it well).<br>Again, I'm not trying to convince you to change your own beliefs, just offer some of the context behind that particular belief, and why we believe that homesexual relationships are sinful. <br>Secondly, racism. We believe (again, assuming that 'we' are actually practicing the full extent of our religion) that racism against anyone for any reason is very sinful. I know what you're referencing, however. It's true that people who were Black weren't allowed to be ordained to Priesthood offices or participate in certain temple ordinances. The church was founded (technically refounded according to our beliefs) in the early 1800s when slavery still existed, and the first prophet of our church denounced slavery. However, later prophets decided to restrict the Priesthood and temple ordinances, whether because of their personal biases or the social and cultural climate of the time. There were explanations that people came up with as to why during that time, but the church doesn't hold any doctinal status. If it was a commandment from God it wasn't because Black people are inferior. This article goes into more depth as to the potential reasoning and context behind it.  <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng">https://www.churchofjesusch...</a><br>Either way, as the church no longer has that restriction, I don't consider it to be a racist organization (otherwise I probably wouldn't be a member), especially since the current leaders of the church have repeatedly said that racism is wrong.<br>In conclusion, I'm not saying that Card is right or wrong for what he did, but I hope this helps clarify some misconceptions about the church, even if they may still seem irrational from the pov of someone who isn't religious. If there's anything you want more elaboration or sources on, or other topics I can explain, I'm willing to do so. If you search pretty much anything on <a href="http://churchofjesuschrist.org" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="churchofjesuschrist.org">churchofjesuschrist.org</a>, there are official explanations for a bunch of things (sure it's biased, but I doubt the sources you've heard things from aren't biased in their own way).</p><p>I hope you're having a good start to the new year! I'll be looking forward to the next chapter of ptoos :D</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey there, thanks for reading and writing out such a heartfelt reply!</p><p>As I tried to convey in the essay itself, I think it's safe to blame this mostly on Card rather than Mormonism, since there are people (like Brandon Sanderson) who are Mormon but struggle to reconcile their religion's views with what feels right, and settle more on the side of "live and let live."</p><p>As for things like the church's views on race, I don't think I find these explanations quite as convincing as you do, and overall there are some deep philosophical and epistemic issues that I have with Mormonism, like any other religion. But I didn't mean to single it out in such a way that implies all Mormons are racist/homophobic, and am sorry if I came off that way.</p><p>Happy new year to you too :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Giovanni is a badass, and his son is really interesting! It's fascinating to see actual insight into the mind of the big bad, albeit through the eyes of outsiders. Where before I thought Giovanni was going to be this cold and ruthless obstacle in Red &amp; Co's way, I can now see him as a more subtle but nevertheless mighty force, whispering to seduce and divide the group. He's a more...human(?) character that I thought he'd be, if that makes sense. He seems acutely aware of his shortcomings, knows the true nature of his power (his network, his charisma) and wields it with extreme expertise. Above all that, he seems extremely driven, on top of already being a legend by the metric of everyone who ever speaks about him in the story. The more I hear about him, the more terrifying he seems, which is absolutely great for the big bad of the first ever pokemon games. <br>Really loving the story so far, I'll be bummed when I reach an end to the chapters!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Maybe kind of a spoiler below? Beware.</p><p>The moment I read the words "Duncan Sabien", my intuition was screaming at me "The probability that this character is going to fuck up anything is virtually zero. They are going to just be awesome".<br>I guess you thought about this issue (i.e., that some people would guess you think highly of Duncan, and that would spoil a bit the mystery of not knowing what kind of a character he is going to be), and decided it is worth it. I wonder whether it does worth it, though (my problem is that I don't know what the pros for doing this are). The difference between this and, say, reading an HP fanfic and knowing from the start that McGonagall is going to be amazing, is that the author could theoretically decide to do something surprising, and actually have a shitty McGonagall for a change.</p><p>Of course, I still enjoyed the dojo scene (and the rest of the chapter). This wall of text is just a thought that I felt like sharing.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The comparison between imaginary numbers and "imaginary colors" was interesting. As a math student, I've found many mathematicians aren't fond of the term. We usually refer to the set of numbers with imaginary components as "complex numbers," which might be a more fitting term for your colors as well. Calling the complex numbers imaginary is often confusing and misrepresenative since all numbers are imaginary, really. The conversation gets more nuanced and I don't pretend to be an expert, but that's my take on it.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<blockquote> Calling the complex numbers imaginary is often confusing and misrepresenative since all numbers are imaginary, really.</blockquote><p>Yes, it <i>would</i> be confusing to call complex numbers imaginary. "Complex" and "imaginary" are distinct concepts, distinct qualities of numbers, and the two terms ought not be used interchangeably. Complex numbers have two components—one real, one imaginary. A genuinely imaginary number has one component, that being the imaginary.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>An interesting thought I had: could someone teleport while holding one of Giovanni's great balls? Presumably they could, right, since you can teleport with pokeballs even when they contain dark Pokemon and since Red has that whole plan to teleport to Bill's with a dying friend in a container. That means that Bill's secret research into containing humans is even more interesting though since it could unlock mass teleportation as well as the aforementioned forward time travel.</p><p>I wonder if Giovanni's ex-renegade slave business is also a good source of test subjects for reanimating contained humans and if he's looking into that.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>People have different definitions for a “nice person.” For example, I consider my current partner nice. I’m happy with how he treats me, he is caring, etc. Yet I know for sure that many other people wouldn’t call him nice. He doesn’t do anything even remotely romantic. (That’s fine with me; I also perceive romantic behaviors as a boring waste of time.) He can be argumentative and harsh with words. (That’s also fine, I am just as argumentative, and the two of us met in a university’s debate club.) He isn’t funny at all. (I like that, my ability to understand jokes is abysmally bad, and communication is simpler when I don’t have to struggle with deciphering other people’s figurative language.) And so on.</p><p>Most people can agree upon some extreme forms of non-niceness (like domestic abuse), but beyond that, people’s definitions differ.</p><p>Also, I have to somewhat disagree with the idea that getting sex is easier with a female body. I came out as trans when I was 23, and before that I lived as a woman. Moreover, I qualified as attractive. Nonetheless, in my late teens/early twenties I spent a lot of time unsuccessfully trying to get laid and feeling just as frustrated as any other guy. In fact, people telling me that getting laid must be easy with a body like mine only made me feel worse about my failure to get laid.</p><p>Here’s the problem—an attractive female body makes it easy to get sex only with a specific subset of men who engage in certain behaviors. Sure, some men approached me, complimented my appearance, tried to flirt with me. Yet every time that happened, I inwardly recoiled and wanted to do nothing with this dude. I have nothing against casual sex if it means some no-strings-attached pleasure for both people who mutually treat each other nicely. But that’s not what these men offered me. They treated me like a piece of meat that’s available for sale. While complimenting me, they dissected the appearance of each of my body parts. It felt like they saw me as just a collection of pretty body parts. Moreover, it felt like they didn’t even want mutual pleasure, it felt like they wanted me as a checkmark in their list of conquests that would allow them to boost their egos.</p><p>Finding a partner I like took me plenty of time and effort. I had a crush on a guy from university (whom I had known for months by then). Although he accepted my invitations to dates pretty much instantly, it still took me months of dating to get him in my bed. It turned out that he was shy, and wasn’t comfortable with instantly jumping in bed. I would have been fine with things progressing faster, but he wasn’t. Once you exclude a certain subset of men (who engage in some behaviors that I perceive as unpleasant), a female body no longer helps getting laid faster.</p><p>This reminds me the odd stereotype that heterosexual men have more extramarital affairs than heterosexual women. It’s inherently impossible, because you would just have to ask with whom exactly are these men sleeping then.</p><p>Similarly, if a dude has to spend months dating a woman before he gets sex, doesn’t that imply that said woman also had to spend months before she got sex? If heterosexual guys have to get though countless frustrating failed dates before they finally find a partner they love, weren’t there women who also participated in these disappointing dates?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ahhhhh. It's too short! This chapter was the most emotionally invested I have felt since Aikos death and the fallout with Blue. Such an exciting chapter, especially considering it just follows Red for a single day, without him even leaving the building once.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I just want to say I am continually beyond impressed by your work. You're writing is rational but it is so full passion. Those don't seem like related traits but you brace the both to their fullest.</p><p>Also I love the LGBT+ representation as well. I was wondering when we'd get to see that. It's great when it's there but not the emphasis of a character. It just is. So thanks for normalizing homosexuality in the pokemon world.</p><p>That said I know you asked for spelling corrections. I haven't found one but I did see what looks like a typo. In this chapter at one point you have Glenn answer the phone saying "Liz" but he calls her "Lizz" when he hangs up. I thought you might like to correct it so they spelling is the same,one z or two. :)</p><p>Again. You're amazing.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I like the idea of debating it. Obviously it depends on your values. If all you value is rationality and saving the most lives possible no matter the cost then I think you could make the case that Giovanni isn't a villain. Even then though, you'll need to contend with all of the murders and deceptions he's committed and facilitated just to not get any results (that great ball scene is absolutely terrifying). So many people dead to capture a storm God and they're all still out there making more events like Viridian and Vermilion. All that work with Archie and Maxie just for the two of them to nearly destroy the world. All those abuses to Mazda for nothing. At this rate, he's doing more harm than good despite his intentions. I could go on, but that's the core of it.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>What a way to start a chapter. I like how the conflict between the trio is going, to me it seems very natural and realistic, especially for preteens. And I like how Leaf is a natural conflict-mediator, like myself. She doesn’t really start fights, but she’s good at ending them. Blue has a protective vibe to me, and so I can understand him not wanting to admit vulnerabilities or seem weak, because it’s harder to be seen as a protector with holes in your shell. By contrast, Red is very much a thinker, but while he’s good at analyzing his feelings (and others, on retrospect), he seems to struggle with instinctively picking up emotions like Leaf. Like Blue, he doesn’t want to admit to weakness because of pride, but from what we’ve learnt of his character here, it’s more a defense mech. When you’re alone like he is, your confidence is the best defense, and it’s easier to be confident when you believe it yourself, so it makes sense he’s hesitant to give any reason to doubt his shield. By contrast, leaf seems secure enough in herself to admit her weaknesses to others. They’re such interesting characters, and I feel we got to know them really well this chapter. It was brilliant, thank you,<br>(TL;DR: red is the brains, Blue is the brawns, and Leaf is the Heart)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Alright!<br>I called it!<br>Ditto rampaging after being created as a byproduct of the cloning, and Giovanni having a plan to "erupt" the island leading to the GSC Cinnabar layout.  <br>I forgot how much I liked the few Shaw PoV chapters we have gotten so far.  Really good character.<br>Feeding on wild pokemon is a very cool aspect of Ditto that seems obvious in hindsight.  I think because i have always just thought of ditto as the perfect breeder, I never considered that it is also the perfect predator once it can basically infiltrate a community/nest.  Gives new meaning to the "Imposter" ability.<br>My favorite line of the chapter:<br>“Ditto that for C18.”<br>I knew I had called it at that point.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>What is there to stop someone from bypassing the trigger mechanism all together? Like, surely after the computer authenticates, it just sends some electronic signal or triggers some device that actually sets off the explosives. Just detach the authentication panel, authenticate on it and record the output signal, then set up a device to relay the signal remotely. It's not like the thing is tamper proof. What's the worst that could happen, it explodes? Maybe it's set to only explode the panel itself if someone messes with it so the rest of the explosives are inaccessible? That seems like a good way to disable the failsafe though, if someone wanted to do that, so not a great design choice. Maybe it isn't tamper proof but every explosive is controlled by an independent computer that relies on a time-sensitive message from the authentication panel so a relay attack won't work because of the delay and Giovanni killed the only guy who knew the algorithm? So then maybe you just detach the whole apparatus and bring it with you? So maybe it could be a bit complicated but surely there's a better option than cutting out Shaw's eye.</p><p>Also somewhat ironically, I suppose the ending of this chapter makes a case for biometrics being a poor authentication method in a world where ditto exist.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I'm not a computer science expert, so many of your points are probably good ones, but keep in mind that they aren't able to stay there at their leisure to do whatever they need to do, both because the longer they waited the more ditto might be born and leave the lab, and because the longer they stayed in the lab to tinker with the explosive control the more sandshrew/sandslash/ditto might attack them. So instead they went with the fastest, surest way to get it done.</p><p>Does that make sense, or is the sort of thing you're imagining something that would just take ~10 minutes to plan and ~1 minute to accomplish?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is hands down my favorite interpretation of a realistic Ditto. I've been wondering for a while now what you would do to rationalize this little guy. I'm sure that there's going to be a handwaving explanation as to why this won't work on legendaries, but even keeping it to 'base' pokemon, the implications are staggering. The ditto becomes identical to the copied pokemon but without any learned behaviors. The exact body, but only pure instincts. It sounds like a debuff, but inherent animal battle instincts have already been shown to be extremely dangerous. In other words, every trainer is going to have to face a pre-caught, sakki version of their own pokemon. That's nuts. Sure, there's some hints about them being glass cannons, but that's still insane. And above and beyond all that, they already actually caught one! Scientific research is going to absolute explode! Human copies are creepy as hell, but they're also perfect genetic replicas that are just ripe for live experimenting. This makes me wonder how you would explain and demonstrate other wacky video game mechanics, like Smeargle's 'Sketch'. Great job!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Finally got caught up after so many years and I got to say, this story is beautiful. Great job with the ditto by the way, I was wondering if you'd make them able to copy humans.</p><p>Here are a few predictions/hopes:</p><p>Red will create partitions modeled after Blue and Leaf, Red/Blue (Purple) will be analogous to what Victory was for Mewtwo, and that will lead Red to do something he regrets at the same time being what makes him a great battler, being able to mimic the battle calm while also being psychic and connecting to his pokemon.</p><p>Some of Mewtwo's DNA comes from Tomio because we all read the same books/comics/manga, or maybe Fuji's or Giovanni's?</p><p>This one I don't think it will happen because of the breadcrumbs pointing more towards Ho-oh and the direct link between Mewtwo and the stormbirds, but Lugia would be perfect as the key to stopping the others, not only because of the movie, as this story seems to be more game focused, but because of it being a pyschic type stormbird basically. Lugia's pokedex entries talk about it bringing a storm when it wakens too, and here is how Red could use his Leaf-model partition to try to connect with it. Not only that, Lugia is lorewise the "leader" of the stormbirds while Ho-oh is the "leader" of the doge trio.</p><p>Not sure we will get to see the other storm birds as much as we got to see Zapdos.</p><p>The ex-leader that is now at the Dojo gives me strong John Kreese vibes, and I assume it is intentional, a big Chekov bomb waiting to explode.</p><p>The Unown connection to another dimension gave me Yog Sothoth vibes and I can only think Giratina, if Red ever figures the origin of species its gotta come from here.</p><p>Whatever the end is for Giovanni, I really hope we get to see Blue challenging him for leadership (this leads to Silver running away from his disgraced father and to him trying to steal a starter rather than use his father's resources).</p><p>Something that I didn't see coming at all:</p><p>The Hoenn arc was wild, and I didn't think it would happen before the Indigo Plateau arc. I think I was expecting more of the classic timeline to be kept, but it worked really well and added even more gravitas to the story. I couldn't help but think "why are we not reading Brandon's/May's story", and while I like that the author addressed that and used it in his favor, I hope we're not robbed from seeing our POV protagonists using something legendary too (That's why I thought Lugia, but Mewtwo would be more obvious because of the game story).</p><p>I love your work, thank you for sharing it with us!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Brilliant chapter, as always.</p><p>"It also can revoke a trainer license, in rare cases where the person’s focus turns more to gaining money or status than becoming a stronger trainer; the League decided long ago not to subsidize those simply trying to game the system."</p><p>I'm interested to see your take on competitive battle facilities like The Battle Frontier. Perhaps especially the Battle Tree which I believe Blue canonically has a hand in starting. Seems to me like they'd waste a lot of talent and resources that could be devoted to defense rather than purely strategic battling with little practical value.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations on 100 chapters! I've been reading on and off for nearly 5 years now and it just keeps getting better. Your consistency and creativity are incredible. I've been struggling to find other fiction I enjoy recently, but your chapters hit the spot every time. Somehow you manage to make writing about a children's game emotionally engaging and thought-provoking in ways I never expect, and your attention to detail is immaculate. It's almost a shame that enjoyment of your work is gated behind being willing to read "Pokemon fan fiction," but I'm nonetheless proud and amazed that something this good can come from such a seemingly niche interest. Thanks again for sharing your world with us. I look forward to continuing reading for as long as you'll keep writing.</p><p>P.S. happy new year!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is all starting to come to a head, isn't it? I can't tell whether Giovanni will be alarmed by such a massive leak or pleased that it's leaked as fiction to throw people off the reality of the situation, but either way he can't be happy about the leak itself. Unless he's the one orchestrating it, which would have its own series of implications. Meanwhile, Sabrina will observe that Red, the person who has been only peripherally introduced to the problem as far as she knows, has a best friend who suddenly spills all the beans in fiction form. What conclusion will she draw from <i>that?</i></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Man, Giovanni's gotta be scrambling right now. I'm sure Sabrina would've let him know ahead of time, but this changes a lot for him. I'm also curious how Mazda will be impacted, since Mewtwo can learn Miracle Eye in the games.</p><p>The depiction of competitive batting is really accurate. I'm impressed. I liked the subtle references to abilities like levitate, magic guard, and intimidate.</p><p>I don't remember is this has been addressed before, but I'm interested in how trade evolutions work. For instance, one would expect Blue to want to evolve Tops into Alakazam and the fact that he hasn't yet implies that it's either not as easy as trading back and forth or that there's good reason to keep a Kadabra for awhile.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, I basically just nix them; even trying to come up with less abusable mechanics, every explanation that I can come up with is still so trivially easy to do that it makes the middle evolutions essentially meaningless. The fact that "trade evolutions" also can be found in the wild in some of the games makes it clear that the mechanic is just a meta-conceit.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ohhh, is he planning on using Red like an inquisitor (with Miracle Eye on his Dark employees)? That sounds like it's something that Red would be super uncomfortable doing, especially if it means using a pokemon on another person.  Renegade-adjacent.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>There's something I'm not clear on. In Market Theory, when Red asked whether the master ball could lead to conflict between regions, Silph said he planned to make it "as widely available as possible". Essentially a MAD-like conflict prevention scheme. If by that he means he's going to sell the ball in PokeShops, won't renegades have access to it then? Why go through all this effort to prevent them from stealing it now if it's almost ready to release?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Good question! The expectation isn't actually that it'll be sold in pokeshops, at least not for a long time; the plan was to put them up for bidding, so it would be clear who has them and only those with lots of money (realistically, governments and some billionaires) would be able to afford them. Silph has very low expectation that the first few dozen would end up in a renegade's hands, and by the time one might then plenty of others will already (ideally) have caught the legendaries.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>As far as people who you want to find out about your secret powers that let you teleport wherever you want and kill dozens of people in minutes, I feel like the police chief who is very clearly not on Giovanni's side (aka the side of keeping secrets) is one of the worst. Honestly once Sabrina and Giovanni find out, I wouldn't be surprised if some people's memories are erased and the whole thing quietly covered up.</p><p>Speaking of Giovanni, I'm very curious why he wants to steal the master ball here. Obviously it'd be beneficial for him to have it, but up until this point his goal has been something like "defeat the storm bringers by any means necessary." Wouldn't the master ball achieve that goal, no matter who has it? Maybe he knows something about <spoiler>giratina</spoiler> that requires him to wield it earlier than he could by buying it after it becomes available? His whole motivation has been hyper rational so far so I'm sure he thinks he has a good reason. I guess there's always the possibility that this isn't him but highly organized groups of renegades are kind of his thing. I'm super interested to see where this goes.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Amazing! This chapter is so loaded with future implications damn. I wonder what sort of training they'll put Red through?? It gets me wondering if this'll continue to actually getting Red on the track to Champion... The story progression had me convinced that this route might not be taken, since Red had a focus on research and like that path is being occupied by Blue for the storyline and canonically Red was just one step behind Blue, but that vould be played off differently, it's still in the cards at this point. Psychic powers are helluva multiplier. That's gotta burn for Blue though, if Red just blasts his way through the League... Esp when he let Red copy Battle Calm...</p><p>I wonder if Giovanni is setting Red up to be some kind of hero what with the suspicious mention of psychics? Or was it out of malice? Idk at this point. Giovanni is wayy to complex for quick assumptions lol</p><p>Archer is Archie?? Team Aqua dude? And the Renegade teams apparently went and merged? Or was that a misdirection? Does that mean N is in cahoots with these people? Probably not?? Questions questions...</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p><spoiler>The way the letter uses the plural pronouns for Red but singular pronouns for the speaker makes me think it's not from Mazda. (Edit: I reread the letter, I am a fool. Ignore that point.) Also, kidnapping or otherwise manipulating Rowan doesn't seem like something Mazda would do though I suppose they might if they're desperate. My guess is the letter is somehow from the Unown hivemind. I suppose a hivemind is kind of like a foil to Red in the sense that Red was one mind that's been broken into multiple while the Unown seem to many that have become one so I'm looking forward to that dynamic.</spoiler></p><p>Blaine having a shiny Charizard is super rad. I'm so excited to see Blue's battle with him based on the way he talks. I love the different personalities that each leader has in this story.</p><p>Bringing up Blue struggling with people who dislike him because of conspiracy theories was a nice touch. That's gotta be really frustrating to experience.</p><p>There was... a significant amount of talk about personal assistants in this one? I'm not sure entirely what to make of that. It's cool to think about at least.</p><p>It's awesome that Red is enjoying digging into this mystery. I hope he gets the chance to meet Dr. Fuji or other Rocket scientists at some point.</p><p>Now that you mention it, it is pretty strange that ditto can't be found underwater in any Pokemon media that I know of. I look forward to the rationalization for that one if there is one. (Apparently ditto can be underwater Pokemon in Pokemon Go)</p><p>Great chapter as always. I admit I was a little disappointed that it didn't jump straight into exploring the lab but I think that was mostly a problem with my own expectations/impatience. Once I got past that, I really enjoyed this chapter for its character development and world building. I look forward to next month's!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p><spoiler>You know if it ends up with Mazda vs Giratina I'm not sure the odds are all that great. Giratina's shadow force definitely ohkos any form of Mewtwo (with the possible exception of shadow mewtwo from pokken tournament but that seems unlikely). Mewtwo is faster but even Mega Mewtwo Y's shadow ball doesn't ohko. Maybe if we consider z moves and terrastilizing it could be possible though. Anyway the odds definitely don't seem to be in Mazda's favor here so I hope they have a plan. </spoiler></p><p>I really enjoyed this chapter. I love when you tap into horror elements like this.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Looking at the title, I was hoping it was going to be a deep dive into how writing fiction works out as a livelihood for you :)</p><p>I just read Metropolitan Man yesterday, I'm kind of surprised you didn't mention it at all, since Lex's primary method of getting things done is by wielding money. Of course, the only people in the story that seem to care about earning money are the henchmen. It's interesting to compare to Dungeons, where, as you mentioned, the explicit goal is initially to earn money, and yet it's not really used for that purpose. But the thing is, Dungeons is just way better - it's one of the best things I've ever read - engrossing, enticing, and beautifully introspective - the characters feel way more real than metropolitan man even though metropolitan man tries harder to be simulationist.</p><p>I think different ways you handle money shows the growth you've made as an author, Alex. Lex uses his superpower, money,  and uses it in a very logical manner to meet his stated goals, but it's just a boring tool. It's not particularly good or interesting writing, and it's used to introduce relatively uninteresting side characters. Compare Lex's character to any of your recent characters and the difference is night and day. I guess the best you could say is that Lex does a good job of being a psuedo-rational strawman (which I get the point of but, as they say, 'ironic shitposting is still shitposting') but the money facet doesn't even further that much - as you said, it just means you give screen time to hired goons instead instead of better characterizing him (and his characterization is lacking).</p><p>The fact that you're just willing to basically completely cut the 'money' aspect from Dungeons, Worth the Candle, and Thresholder because they don't serve the story or the characters shows how much you've grown as an author. It would have made logical sense for the teams in both Dungeons and Worth the Candle to buy much more powerful entads, pay for training, etc. but it really wouldn't have served the story at all. In fact it would have been antithetical to the super satisfying chapters where the teams are rewarded for their hard work with entad lootboxes. Worth the Candle in particular would make the most logical sense for this, since at least in Dungeons there's the narrative excuse that Alfric is basically just an upper class dude slumming it (cue up 'common people' by pulp), so it makes that he'd want to be self-reliant on the entads they delve themselves, and the stakes of failure are low since his team is immortal.</p><p>I guess the irony here is that I'd consider all three of your recent stories to be much better rational fictions than Metropolitan Man. The characters are much more human and they're significantly more philosophically insightful. I'd routinely spend an afternoon introspecting on little details of chapters in Worth the Candle, whereas I just read all of Metropolitan man yesterday and I didn't really feel anything or learn anything at all even though literally the entire novel is a blunt metaphor for the AI safety debate. I love seeing your growth as an author, it's like a real life progression fantasy ;) I could feel the difference between early Worth the Candle and late Worth the Candle, but the difference is even more stark in comparison to Metropolitan Man.</p><p>One other novel comes to mind where money is central (and is dealt with pretty well) is 'Player Manager - A Sports Progression Fantasy'. It also happens to be one of the best written works on Royal Road. I don't even like sports. The protagonist generallly doesn't have much money, it makes sense for him to be, and it affects his life at the start of the story - he spends the first book or two working in a shitty call center to survive. It's very grounded but it's not depressing like you mentioned 'Maid' being. Money is also pretty central later on in the funding of the various football clubs he works for, but it's not annoying, and it's used intelligently and it never feels like he's leaving anything on the table. I generally find all the 'financial management' aspects super interesting, which I guess is a pretty huge accomplishment considering how dry it could be. There's lots of interesting stuff - like the tradeoffs between scouting cheap talent but having to invest time training them, or paying extra to buy it premade, and interesting discussions of the entire economics of buying players, improving them, and selling them to other clubs. Do you spend 100k investing in better facilities, or do you use that money to buy a slightly better striker? How do you balance short term victories against long term club health?</p><p>I find money grating in stories when it's actively used, but used badly, and not for anything useful. In "Ghost in the City: Cyberpunk Gamer SI" the protagonist spends the whole time being an overpowered murderhobo. They make lots of money and use it to do pretty much nothing directly useful. They get a nice motorbike and buy something nice for their brother, and that'd be fine except they're living in abject poverty in a slum. They don't even use the money to buy overpowered guns or something (which would be totally in character). They just use it for a little glorified wish fulfilment and it makes the story worse. It would have been better for money to just be handwaved away and for it to have never been used for anything. Or at least lean in to the overpowered proto-garn-ist thing and use all the money to break the game. Why am I even writing about this? Maybe it's because I wasted my life reading 115 chapters of that crap? Maybe it's because it's on page 1 of Royal Road and This Used to be About Dungeons is on page 8 and that breaks something inside of me a little?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In the game, MissingNo appears when it needs to select a Pokemon from a table that doesn't have any. Everyone could have probably kept their Internet if there'd been more fossils around the lab to be revived. I wonder how the world will react to Artem walking around with his supply box converted into tons of candy and gold for no reason now (or you know whatever it is he had).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>While I haven't read a ton of Psychic Battles put into words, this one felt phenomenally unique and methodically designed. Tense, meaningful, and cleverly (ab)used the fact that psychics can Amnesia (or partition) memories to surprise both their opponent and the reader. Also, finally, the dreamer has made contact, a moment I've been eagerly awaiting for months or even years to see. It's both fulfilling to finally see, and yet a most terrible tease since it was cut off. I'm going to cross my fingers that their conversation in full arrives with the next chapter, possibly even from the other side's viewpoint.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Daystar,<br>I’ve been reading pokemon and the origin of species for almost a decade. It feels like it’s been longer. In the classic style of a modern parasocial relationship I don’t know you, and you know me even less, but when you post a day or a week late I notice and wonder and hope you’re well.<br>Every time you post a few days late with an apology I appreciate your tenacity. To have pushed through whatever challenges hit you upside your proverbial head that month and still pulled through only a few days late impresses me. I hope that this is a type2 fun challenge for you and adds to your life rather than doubling down the challenges during the hard times.<br>That you've exposed me to high level thought processes through, what is on its surface, such a silly medium as a pokemon fanfic is sublime. You are quite the person.<br>I appreciate the last 9 years I’ve had the privilege to read your work. I hope simultaneously that your story ends soon and goes for the rest of my life. I want -need- to know the resolution to this epic. But leaving these characters stories will be a loss to my monthly agenda.<br>If I could change something about your story it would be to have reached out years ago. And for you to be able to publish and monetize this epic adventure.</p><p>See you next month</p>]]></message>
