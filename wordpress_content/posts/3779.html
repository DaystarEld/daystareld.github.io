Someone on Twitter said:<br>
<br>
</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<blockquote><br>
<div dir="auto">I am guilty of deliberately stating things in a bold & provocative form on here in order to stimulate discussion. Leaving hedges & caveats for the comments section. On net, I think this is better than alternatives, but I’m open to being convinced otherwise.</div></blockquote><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto">And I finally felt the urge to write up thoughts I've had about what I'll call "clickbait soapboxing" for the past year or so. A disclaimer is that I feel like I could write a whole book on this sort of thing, and will inevitably have more complex thoughts about what I say here that comes off as simple.</div><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto">Also, I'm not <em>super</em> confident I am right to feel so strongly about how bad it seems, and also also, I personally like many people (like the above poster) who regularly do this.</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">But I don't feel at all confident that people doing it are tracking all the effects it has, and they certainly don't seem to acknowledge it. So this seems maybe like it's useful to say explicitly.</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">First off, some of these are clearly a "me" thing. For example, I have trouble trusting people to be as capable of "actual" vulnerability or sincerity when they don't put effort into representing their thoughts accurately. It feels, at best, like a shield against criticism: "I was  wrong on purpose!"</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">But I know others struggle with inhibition/social anxiety: "I'd rather speak boldly, knowing I'm wrong in some way, than not speak at all!" Which, yeah, makes sense! But are you planning to ever address the root cause? Is it healing, or cope/crutch? (Not judging, I really don't know!)</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">In any case, there are still externalities. Illusion of transparency is real! Typical mind fallacy is real!</div><br>
</div><br>

Should you care? <i>shrug</i> What makes us care about anything we say in the first place? Just don’t motte-bailey “communicating for self-expression” or "processing out loud" vs “sharing ideas and learning" or "talking about True Things."<br>
<br>
</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto">As for me (and maybe others out there like me), the effects include things like thinking:</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">"Did this person actually change their mind? Do they actually believe the more nuanced thing? Or are they just backpedaling due to getting stronger pushback than expected?"</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">As well as:</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">"Are they actually interested in learning and sharing interesting ideas? Or are they optimizing for <em>being</em> interesting and getting followers?"</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">And</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">"If they misinform someone, would they care? Would they do it on purpose, if it got them likes and subscribes?"</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">I don't make judgements like these lightly. These are just thoughts that I have about people, possibilities that seem ever so slightly more likely, the more I see them engage in sloppy or misleading communication practices.</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>

<div dir="auto"><br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vZssZr2wq7YrG3FMa/creating-a-truly-formidable-art">Val</a> writes well about a sense of "stillness" that is important to being able to think and see and feel clearly. I think the default for news media, social media, and various egregores in general are to hijack our attention and thought patterns, channel them into well-worn grooves.<br>
<br>
And I have a hard time feeling trust that people who (absent forewarning/consent) <em>try</em> to trigger people in any way in order to have a "better" conversation... are actually prioritizing having a better conversation? It seems like the same generators are at work as when an organization or ideology does it.<br>
<br>
</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto">And all this is, in my view, very clearly eroding the epistemic commons.</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">Humans are social monkeys. Loud emotive takes drown out nuanced thoughtful ones. People update off massively shared and highly upvoted headlines. Far fewer read the nuanced comments.</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto">And very few, vanishingly few, seem to reliably be able to give themselves space to feel when they're thinking, or give themselves trust to think when they're feeling. I certainly don't always react gracefully to being triggered.</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">So why shrink that space? Why erode that trust? Are you driven more by worry you won't be able to speak, or fear you won't feel heard? And then, fear you won't feel heard, or anxiety your views won't be validated?</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">I dislike psychoanalysis, and I definitely don't assert these things as sure bets of why people do what they do. But it's what bubbles up in my thoughts, and it's what inhibits trust in my heart.</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">And all this also acts as a bit of an explanation to those who've asked me why I don't use twitter much. By design, it feels antagonistic to giving people space to think and feel; writers unless they pay money, and readers unless they fight an endless war of attrition against things trying to eat their attention and turn them into balls of rage and fear.</div><br>
</div><br>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><br>
<div dir="auto"></div><br>
<div dir="auto">I've no reason to make such a system work, and I'm uninterested in making it work "for me." In my heart, that feels like surrender to the same generators destroying public discourse, and leads otherwise thoughtful and caring people to being a bit less so, for the sake of an audience.</div><br>
