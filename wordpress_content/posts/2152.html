<p> I wouldn't have minded the pacing (it did indeed create atmosphere very well) if it wasn't at the cost of actual plot development. And it was certainly fun finally seeing the source of so many modern sci-fi tropes.<br><br>The problem is the movie was essentially two unconnected plots: a Mystery film concerning the Monolith and a Suspense film concerning HAL. If the latter was released as a short film, it would have been awesome. If the former had been released as a short film, it would also have been great, if somewhat unfulfilling. Because absolutely nothing connects the two but circumstance, however, it feels disjointed, like someone looked at the story, said "This doesn't have any action in it!" and jammed in a subplot about the dangers of AI.<br><br>And then they top off the awesome premise of the mysterious monolith with 10 minutes of utterly contextless mindfuck, and an abrupt cut to black mid-non-sequitor.<br><br>"It's thought provoking!"<br><br>That's because the human mind abhors a vacuum. Cut any story off halfway through and that'll be "thought provoking" too, let alone just as things seem to be coming to a head, because you're automatically start wondering what happens next.<br><br>It's also not a complete story. Thinking up a cool premise is only half the job of a storyteller: there still needs to be some resolution to that story. Why on earth would Kubrick get a pass on this? It has nothing to do with being "spoonfed" anything, and everything to do with whether or not the movie, *without any supplemental knowledge,* makes sense.<br><br>Now, as I mentioned, knowing there is a sequel and knowing that there's more to the story than what was presented in the film makes it a better story. Hell if the movie had said To Be Continued at the end, I wouldn't have felt cheated at all.<br><br>But it didn't. And it still would have been a better film with the context to connect the HAL and Monolith plots.<br><br>Here was my interpretation of it, knowing absolutely nothing going in but a few references from other things:<br><br>OK, there's this strange monolith that made those monkeys start using tools. Interesting, so human evolution was the result of some alien intervention. Oh, the bone turned into a spaceship, that's clever. Heh, velcro shoes to combat lack of gravity... Ok, space travel would probably be this monotonous. Russians and Americans working together? Mighty optimistic for a movie from the Cold War. Okay, so they found another Monolith on the moon. I guess that was humanity passing its first test... now what happens to them? 18 months later... Ah, this is where HAL comes in. Did humans invent AI after the second exposure to the Monolith? That's pretty cool... man that voice *is* creepy, and not because it's monotone; because it's not. Oh come on you idiots, why would you turn the pod around, he couldn't see you before... probably reading their lips... yep, reading their lips. Should've brought your helmet bud. Huh, would that work? I know you can survive for a bit in space, but wouldn't you be burned and frostbitten and knocked out? I guess he was shielded from the sun... Aw, poor HAL. Hey, he didn't say "I'm scared Dave, will I dream?" I wonder where that got started... ok, now he's at Jupiter... okay... o...kaaaay... right... pretty lights... got it... is he going through hyperspace? GAH! Scary face! .........*sighs*........okay. In a room. Not too creepy. Is the Architect going to show up now? Mental projection of the aliens...? Woah, he's been through the wringer. Now I know where Stephen King got that bit from The Jaunt from. Wait where'd the space ship go? Oh, I see... and then he's gone from... yep, and then the bed... yeah. Aaand Monolith? Monolith. Creeeepy. And... space-baby? Ok that's kind of disturbing... so he's turning into something new, or is he trapped in some life-loop? NOW do we meet the aliens...? Wait. What? That's it? Seriously? Oh fuck you Kubrick.<br><br>Bottom line is, he's a great director/writer, but I don't give people credit for mysterious-mind-fuck endings. Evangelion pissed me off with it, and so did 2001. I can see why the ideas it presented made it a classic, but as a movie it left a bad taste in my mouth, and I would no doubt have enjoyed the book more (surprise!). </p><br>
