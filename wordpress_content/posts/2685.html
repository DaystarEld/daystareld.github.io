        <span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ideal world, everyone comes from lovely, supportive families that accept whoever they marry and get along with their new in-laws and respect the couple’s boundaries and wishes for how their children will be raised.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, in the real world, many people want little or nothing to do with their families once they’re adults, in-laws regularly make snide or condescending comments whenever they visit, and statistically speaking your own parents probably don’t respect your boundaries, let alone those of your partner.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people have great relationships with their family, and don’t understand how anyone could </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to visit on holidays or have grandparents involved in child rearing. Others get along okay with their parents while recognizing their flaws, but feel awkward about how adamantly their spouse dislikes them, or vice-versa. Bad enough if holidays are the only times tensions rise; what if you live near one or both sets of parents? Can they drop in any time? Who’s responsible for telling them they can’t, if someone’s not comfortable with that?</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike sexual or romantic orientation, I believe family orientation is mostly the result of nurture rather than nature. Some cultures, particularly Western ones, are very individualistic; “I married you, not your family” is a phrase you might hear fairly often in couples counseling. But other cultures have a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">very </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">strong</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">family orientation, such that it’s taken for granted that multiple generations will live together; when you marry someone, you are in a very real sense joining their family, not just creating a new independent unit.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the effects of culture are the effects of upbringing. A loving and nurturing family will make it easy for people to want to involve family in their lives even after they grow older and start their own. A mixed upbringing or family with some good and bad members or memories may make some extended enmeshment feel acceptable, but not too much. And a traumatic upbringing will make people want to never see their family again, or (sadly often) feel guilted into doing so by those family members or their culture while continuing to suffer... though it might make someone very happy to spend time with their partner's family, if it's less dysfunctional.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some real, hard questions that need to be answered in this space. Not just how involved in potential children’s lives will they be or how often you’ll visit whose family, but also how will you care for family members if they get old/sick? Will they live with you? How much will you be expected to bend to family’s preferences vs standing firm on your own? How much should you contribute to bailing family out of poor financial decisions? How much is “appropriate” to tell your family about your relationship?</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When two people have very different orientations on this it can cause endless drama, and that gets worse if one side’s family is actually abusive or manipulative in ways that they’re used to and find hard to notice.</span><br>
<br>
<b>How does the orientation frame help?</b><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication and clear expectations are key to navigating these issues in general, and just speaking your preference and inviting your partner’s perspective on how much or little you prefer extended family be involved in the new family you create together can be very valuable.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people are very open about this (“If my family doesn’t like you we have a problem,” or “I don’t want to see my family ever again”), and if that’s the case, respecting those orientations is important. It isn’t necessarily mutual; some people are okay with their partner’s family but not their own, might even prefer them. But respecting your partner’s boundaries when it comes to family involvement, particularly their own, can head off a lot of difficulties.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an orientation where change is possible to some degree, because it’s predicated in large part on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">extrinsic factors.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most people would want supportive, loving, interesting people in their life. Most people do not want selfish, hurtful, boring people in their life, but will make an exception for family because they’ve been conditioned to think it’s okay or normal. If you notice your partner’s orientation is very closed to extended family involvement, noticing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that might be the case can be very useful; if it’s something that can be changed, changing it might help their orientation soften. </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t try to change their mind without at least recognizing the cause of it, and notice that the frame of “orientation” still points to something </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">intrinsic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; even with perfectly fine and positive family members on both sides, some people are more private than others, or more introverted, or more independent. </span>
