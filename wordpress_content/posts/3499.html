I don't tend to give advice without getting the chance to ask a bunch of questions first, as I'm not actually sure what the writer is trying to find, specifically. More enjoyment of life? Finding something more ambitious/"meaningful" to do? Reduction of regret/bitterness? Each would lead to somewhat different suggestions, but... a quick overview of actionable items for each that come to mind, and some books to read at the end:<br>
<br>
1) Make a list of all the things you know you'd enjoy doing, and make a second list of all the things you think you might enjoy trying. Let your imagination wander, don't worry about how "realistic" it is, you can prune later. Just let yourself actually feel the freedom to explore the possibilities life has to offer. Also, reach out to or find others who are interested in those things. Online forums can be great places to meet similarly minded people, and there's a subreddit for everything.<br>
<br>
2) Meaning is a hard thing to direct people to, as I believe everyone has to find it for themselves. But noticing what feels "good," however that's identified in your body, is an important first step, and noticing what feels "fulfilling" is a second. Think of times you have felt the most glad to be not just alive, but YOU. The times you felt like your unique self has been what the world needed, or times when you felt like you really enjoyed who you were and what you were doing with your life. Another way to think about this is, if you were given a billion dollars, and take for granted that you've managed the wealth to your satisfaction to keep your needs all met and all the charitable options/investments done... what would you do with your time after that?<br>
<br>
3) I'll try not to have my therapist hat on here, since you indicated that you dislike having your feelings normalized. But I think emotions are best worked through via acknowledgement, understanding, and expression. Finding out how to do that is difficult though. I recommend reading books like The Body Keeps the Score, as well as Unlocking the Emotional Brain, maybe even Focusing to learn an extra technique for understanding and working through difficult or mysterious emotions. The Art of Accomplishment podcast is also a great exploration of how to orient toward emotions, as well as relationships with others.<br>

Here's an episode of AoA that you might particularly identify with at the moment:<br>
