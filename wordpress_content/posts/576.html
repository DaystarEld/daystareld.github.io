        In <a href="https://daystareld.com/pokemon-chapter-20/">Chapter 20 of The Origin of Species</a>, Red uses a mental flowchart to identify why he's so upset at something Psychic Narud said to him.  People have asked what it's from, so here is a rough draft of that flowchart in its entirety.  I came up with it as a way to help clients improve awareness of what upsets them and work through why, and you're welcome to use it as you will. (You may need to "open image in new tab" to read it.)<br>
