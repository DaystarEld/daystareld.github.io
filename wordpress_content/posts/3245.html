        When you dig into the justifications for following a moral rule or virtue even if it leads to what looks like a bad outcome, people will often say it’s still worth doing because following the rule or virtue is expected to lead to overall better outcomes in the long run… which is just another way of saying they care about the expected consequences, just on a longer timeline. But real consequentialists use the same argument against doing things that appear to have a good immediate outcome if they expect it to have a bad one in the long run or if universalized. So error correction seems like the real thing that distinguishes whether someone is a consequentalist or not, and it is a rare deontologist or virtue ethicist who won’t take any expectation or models of outcomes into consideration at all when deciding what moral rules or virtues to follow...
