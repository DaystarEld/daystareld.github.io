        <em>(This is going to be another brief + tips oriented review of IFS concepts; be sure to read the <a href="https://daystareld.com/emotional-ifs-integration-101/">101</a> post if you're totally new to this)</em><br>
<br>
Not all parts that can exist inside you are naturally there or equally fleshed out. Circumstances in life will strengthen one or another, but like the saying about the two wolves inside us, you can also intentionally “feed” specific parts to make them stronger, and there’s one part in particular that your whole system will benefit from having strong.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some call it the Ideal Parent Figure, others the Ideal Future Self, Inner Champion, Inner Mentor, etc. By some interpretations these could be considered "guides" or "critters" or "voices" rather than parts, in that they may speak to you but not want to act on their own, but that might vary per person. Additionally, </span>their roles are subtly different based on the internal system they’re part of, but are still broadly those of Mediator, Comforter, and Encourager, whose primary value is their endless compassion for you and your parts.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-compassion is crucial to IFS, not as a prerequisite but as the primary ingredient for true acceptance of your parts/emotions, productive forgiveness for your mistakes, and a dignity that no one and nothing in life can take away from you. When you unconditionally love yourself, all sorts of healing and growth become possible, and you can create much stronger boundaries between yourself and harm.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing and feeding these inner parts can look similar, but experimentation can help find which works best for you. For this post I’ll just give brief advice for the first two:</span><br>
<br>
<b>Ideal Parent Figure </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is often a source of compassionate mediation between your parts. It helps you bring the Exiles in from the cold, soothe Anxiety’s fear of being ignored, understand Anger’s justifications, relax Firefighters’ vigilance, etc. Those who had abusive or distant parents often don’t know where to start with constructing this, unless they’re lucky enough to have met a friend’s parent or other mentor in their life who can serve as a model. Fictional characters can work too; Mr. Rogers is an example of someone widely considered a “platonic parental figure,” and many have found comfort and self-compassion by internalizing his “voice” and perspective to help replace some of the more harmful self-talk and their own (often well intentioned) imperfect parents left them with. You can also </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAcUlVEbAtg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use this Protocol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help visualize what having a part like this could actually look like.</span><br>
<br>
<b>Ideal Future Self</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in many internal systems (my own included) serves identical purposes to the IPF; it’s particularly useful for those who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">had </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no sense of “parents” as a distinct emotional category, positive or negative, by instead drawing directly on your aspirations. Constructing and feeding your Ideal Future Self is done by thinking over and writing out what a version of you with all the skill and wisdom that you hope to develop would say if they were around and freely able to give it to you, all in a compassionate way. Your ideal self would not judge any shortcomings and failings you have, because they remember your journey and all the difficulties you struggled with along the way. They serve less often as the mediator for your other parts (those without “parent” as emotional category are more likely to act as their own internal mediator), and more a source of encouragement for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; they believe in you, and care about you, and are waiting for you, no matter how long it takes. This means that you can also develop them by writing to your past self, and telling them what you wish someone had told you, particularly in your darkest moments. Like with the IPF, it can often be very healing to deliberately imagine yourself hugging your past self as you deliver the words, and similarly imagine your future self using soothing touch as they comfort and encourages you.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychologically, whatever this part is called, it acts as a container for all the things you intellectually might believe, but still have trouble emotionally accessing at all times, particularly at your low points.  Samples of the sorts of things they would often say include:</span><br>
<ul><br>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t have to be perfect to deserve love and kindness.”</span></li><br>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know it’s hard, but I’m proud of the progress you’re making.”</span></li><br>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s nothing wrong with your wants/feelings, even if they’re confusing.”</span></li><br>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You made a mistake, but it doesn’t have to define you.”</span></li><br>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can get through this. I believe in you.”</span></li><br>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s okay to hurt. I’m here. We’ll get through this together.”</span></li><br>
</ul><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s okay if you don’t believe these just yet, or if there are other voices shouting the opposite. The purpose of taking time to better build up these models and strengthen these parts is to help make these feel more real, particularly if you have memories of times they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">did </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel true and spend time meditating on those experiences.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once these parts are solid enough, they make practically every other aspect of emotional integration easier. It’s quite literally like having a perfect ally travel everywhere with you, ready and waiting to step in and help you whenever you need a steadying hand and comforting word.</span><br>
