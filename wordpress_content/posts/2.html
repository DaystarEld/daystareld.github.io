        Hey, welcome to my site. I'm using it as a handy way to consolidate all my various writings across the web, which includes stories like Pokemon: The Origin of Species, game or show reviews, and articles on everything from romance to politics. It's also a good place to list the projects I'm working on, like my board game Tavern Wars.  Whatever led you here, I hope you find other stuff you like. Kick your shoes off, find a comfy couch, stay awhile and listen.<br>
<br>
Better yet, speak up if you've got something to say. I'm happy to talk as long as I've got an interested audience, but there's nothing I value more than learning. If this site has any use besides entertainment, let it be a place for that.<br>
<br>
Long days and pleasant nights.<br>
