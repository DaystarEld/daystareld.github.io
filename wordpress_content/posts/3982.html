        One commonality I have seen across the political spectrum is the purity test: a strict ideological standard that members of a group, movement, or community are expected to meet to be considered truly belonging or "legitimate."<br>
<br>
Even libertarians, who in America often self-style as more independent thinkers, are not immune to it, nor is intelligence a protection; I have seen extremely smart and thoughtful people criticize their close-ideological neighbors in ways that to them I'm sure seems substantive, but to me feels like an obvious purity test.<br>
<br>
In basically any context, I consider purity testing a fully general anti-rational meme, in the Deutschian sense: a meme that impedes reflection, adaptation, or growth. Philosophies are dangerously seductive when they make you feel like they have all the answers, and one of the surest signs of dogmatism I know is someone believing that following some basic principles or set of standards will lead to all the best outcomes everywhere.<br>
<br>
Life is complicated. Society is complicated. We do not have nearly all the answers to the most pressing issues we face.  If you think just taking the "Liberty" dial or the "Safety" dial or the "Equal Outcomes" dial and crank it all the way up will lead to the best possible world, this seems obviously dogmatic, to me.<br>
<br>
If you convince yourself, or are convinced by others, that doing so will wrap-around excess benefits so much that the other values will not suffer for it, this seems a particularly strong sign of political mindkill.<br>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">And worst of all, if you reject others who share your values simply because they don't advocate for the most extreme version of those values, or imply they don't <em>really </em>care about the values or principles, you're engaging in harmful purity testing.</p><br>

Once even minor deviation seems bad, once anyone who doesn't conform entirely to the espoused principles seems by-default wrong, weak, or hypocritical... the memeplex you're espousing has become less adaptable, and the egregore has you in a chokehold, no matter how comfortable it feels.<br>
<br>
It's trite among intellectuals these days to say that people should be willing to examine their own side for false beliefs, and notice if they might be wrong about something. But you will still find smart, thoughtful people uncritically rejecting the idea that their favored, guiding values and principles might need to compromise sometimes for a better society.
