<p data-offset-key="2re2s-0-0"><em>(The following is my own understanding and practice of IFS, and may include elements that conflict with the standard model. In an attempt to keep these brief I won't be going into much theory, and focus on what seems to work best for myself and my clients)</em></p><br>
<p class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="2re2s-0-0">Internal Family Systems is a form of therapy that treats psychological or emotional difficulty as the result of disagreements between the "parts" that make you who you are. Sometimes these parts make themselves known as (disagreeing/discordant) thoughts, other times as (conflicting/painful) emotions. A variety of labels can be useful to identify and understand their effects and interactions; in the classic model, these are Exiles, Firefighters, and Managers, as well as the Self, which is the "part" that your conscious mind remains associated with even amidst fragmentation.</p><br>
<p class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="2re2s-0-0">But there are many forms IFS can take, or layers that can be applied onto each other. For some, characterizing their parts as actual family members (Child, Teenager, Adult) is very useful. For others, a starship crew (Security, Engineering, Science, Captain) makes for easier internal communication. Whatever form these parts take, IFS can be valuable for many purposes, but the most straightforward one is simple "emotional integration," which is to say, conversely, feeling more like a unified individual rather than struggling with emotional turmoil over some looming decision or past action.</p><br>
<p class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="2re2s-0-0">The path to integration looks something like this:</p><br>
<br>

<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="dkcaq" data-offset-key="1jm7f-0-0"><br>
<p class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="1jm7f-0-0"><em>Acknowledge->Identify->Accept->Manage->Integrate</em></p><br>
<br>
</div><br>
<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="dkcaq" data-offset-key="vcl8-0-0"><br>
<div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="vcl8-0-0"><span data-offset-key="vcl8-0-0">This is not always linear progression, as emotions and parts might shift or grow nuanced over time. It's also uneven; you can have one emotion Integrated, while struggling to Accept another and having trouble Identifying a third.</span></div><br>

<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="dkcaq" data-offset-key="4ars5-0-0"><br>
<div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="4ars5-0-0"><span data-offset-key="4ars5-0-0">Most people who struggle with emotions/parts are either trying to skip ahead, or mistakenly believe they have succeeded at one step before they actually have. It's also not always fully in our control. It can take time to process things, particularly traumatic things, and that's okay.</span></div><br>

<div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="84gpa-0-0"><span data-offset-key="84gpa-0-0">There are skills that help with each. Meditation and mindfulness techniques help with Acknowledging. <a href="https://amzn.to/3K9JAjK">Gendlin Focusing</a> helps with Identifying. Eliminating "shoulds" helps with Acceptance. Note that eliminating "shoulds" includes eliminating "shouldn'ts." Parts are what they are, even if confused/traumatized. Healing starts with compassion toward your part, or yourself for having it.</span></div><br>

<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="dkcaq" data-offset-key="6eh1u-0-0"><br>
<div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="6eh1u-0-0"><span data-offset-key="6eh1u-0-0">(This can, admittedly, be tricky if those shoulds and shouldn'ts feel like they're coming from other parts! But your "core self" can then differentiate itself from the part that's expressing the should, and accept both parts, the same way writers learn to harness their inner critic rather than silence or be cowed by it.)</span></div><br>

<div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="4jos4-0-0"><span data-offset-key="4jos4-0-0">Learning conflict mediation helps with Managing, whether you act as the Mediator between your parts or one of parts takes on that role. Systems theory, cybernetics, NVC, reflective listening, double crux, all that fun stuff are useful here. Again, these are learnable skills, and it doesn't take much more work to apply them to your parts instead of other people; just extra imagination and honesty and self-compassion.</span></div><br>

<br>
<span data-offset-key="agvr2-0-0">Finally, Integration comes from practice, patience, and trust. As I said, it's not always a steady progression. We encounter new things, life gets messy, parts get out of sync. But trust yourself, be patient with yourself, practice the skills, and the rest of you will be ready and waiting to re-integrate until you feel like unified again.</span><br>
